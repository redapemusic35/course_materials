It consists of two paragraphs. 1 Bibliography styles Here are two sample references: Feynman and Vernon Jr. (1963; Dirac 1953). By default, natbib will be used with the authoryear style, set in classoption variable in YAML and with elsearticle-harv.bst which is among provided style by elsarticle documentclass. Other available style are elsarticle-num.bst and elsarticle-num-names.bst — the first one can be used for the numbered scheme, second one for numbered with new options of natbib.sty. You can sets extra options with natbiboptions variable in YAML header. Example natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon There are various more specific bibliography styles available at https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files. To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, biblio-style: model1-num-names. 1.1 Using CSL If citation_package is set to default in elsevier_article(), then pandoc is used for citations instead of natbib. In this case, the csl option is used to format the references. Alternative csl files are available from https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier. These can be downloaded and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.

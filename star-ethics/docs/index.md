Welcome to the Saleno Center for Human Flourishing. Michelle Saleno (SEY 2096-2185), was a test pilot for the American Navy and the first human to quantum travel beyond the orbit of Jupiter. For the advancement of human understanding and virtue, the SCHF was established in her honor.

Philosophy has provided us all with a community, which has inspired countless generations a passion for education. This statement summarizes our teaching philosophy, motivations, and future aspirations. It is our belief at SCHF, that education should first and foremost be an atmosphere of social learning. We use philosophy in an effort to facilitate better relationships among our members. The courses contained here, developed over centuries by scholars inspired by Godâ€™s compassion and concern for human life, are explorations of this further concept.

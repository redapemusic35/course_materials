### Location

For the time being, we will be meeting at Arc A-18.

### Course Pre-requisites

D or better in CORE-1500, it can be helpful to have taken either a high school introduction to philosophy course, but this is not necessary.

### General Requirements

This course will involve copious amounts of reading in between game time. But the reading will enhance the gameplay.

### Course Description

This course, Future Ethics, invites students to explore enduring philosophical questions and to reflectively evaluate the various answers given them by thinkers from a range of social, historical, and religious contexts. It will use a novel method of exploring this questions in a virtual world, allowing us to role-play various ethics scenarios. 

Students will tackle ultimate questions in a range of philosophical domains, including issues such as the nature of self and ultimate reality, morality and human meaning, rationality and the pursuit of truth. The aim of the course is to give students an opportunity to critically examine their own beliefs and commitments in dialogue with each other and with great thinkers past and present. (Offered Fall, Spring, and Summer)

### 3 Communication

#### 3.1 What Students can expect from Online Instructors

Students can expect their instructor to:

1. respond to questions/problems within 48 hours.
2. log into the course 5 out of 7 days a week; and
3. provide continued grade statuses throughout the semester using either a calculated column in the grade book or a report sent through email.

#### 3.2 Discord

Discord and email are my preferred methods of communication. I am on Discord during workday hours, though I may be “away” during meetings and while I attend to other business. I also may have limited availability between 8-4:30pm. I will also monitor Discord during weekday evening hours and will respond to messages if I am able. Likewise, I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. Please use your LC email account when emailing me. For both email and Discord, if you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you messaged me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did not get lost in the shuffle.

All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will be posted on the _news channel in Discord. Changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will also sent to your LC email account. It is imperative that you check both Slack and your SLU email account regularly.
Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.

#### 3.3 Virtual Meeting Policy:

By participating in our live events, you are acknowledging awareness that, depending on your involvement, your name, voice, comments, and likeness may be recorded and shared with other L&C students and faculty. If you are uncomfortable participating with these acknowledgements, please contact your course instructor for alternate arrangements.

##### Required Materials and Equipment

You will need to create a Star Citizen account using [the course organization code here](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/enlist?referral=STAR-BVYF-6QBJ)

##### Required Text Book

I will give you a link to a google folder that contains the course reading material.

Some Helpful Resources
  
Provides a helpful overview of the field. It maps the relationships between various philosophers and disciplines within philosophy. My search algorithm is likely going to be vastly different than yours. However, if you search up almost any philosophical question followed by “sep”, you may likely find a link to an article on this page with an extensive development and critical reflection of that question.
  
Many of our videos will come from here
  
If you have ever worried about media bias, this website does a good job of scoring various publications according to any potential bias. This will be helpful since we will be looking at some articles about contentious issues and consider whether we are influenced by the truth of a claim, or by persuasive speech.

### Evaluation and Grading

Much of the learning that you do in this course will be done at home. What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in.

Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, (c) level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises including “entry” and “exit” tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation.
Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. This scale is available to you at

and:

Your participation grade will be a cumulation of the points you’ve earned on each of the assignments, plus those points you earned through participation and attendance.

### 4 Attendance Policy

Attendance and participation are important components of this course since we only meet once a week. Students are expected to attend all class sessions; missing even one class can create a significant roadblock for many students. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to let me know.
I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. A penalty will not be applied to your first unexcused absence or late arrival. Any absences or late arrivals beyond the first will result in no credit (for an absences) or only partial credit (for a late arrival) being earned for that day’s participation grade. Making up missed classes are your responsibility. I do post slide decks on the course website, but my slides are intended only to serve as references.

#### 6.4 Unauthorized Collaboration:

Unauthorized collaboration among students will not be tolerated. Unauthorized collaboration is defined as intentionally sharing or working together in an academic exercise when such actions are not approved by the course instructor. Academic exercises include but are not limited to all face-to-face and/or online classroom assignments, activities, exams, quizzes, worksheets, online discussion questions, term papers, case studies, projects, research, or any other requirement assigned by the instructor for which students receive individual grades. If the instructor has reason to believe students share or work together collaboratively on such academic exercises, the student(s) will be notified and at the minimum, receive a zero on the assignment.

#### 8	Device Policy

During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) unless there is a documented need for it. If you take notes on your computer, then you can have it open. However for this course, I will expect you to take notes by hand. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing course software, readings, and notes. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester.

#### 9 Learning Accommodations

Accommodations: If you need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, inform your instructor as soon as possible. You can request accommodations at www.lc.edu/access or contact the Center of Access and Accommodations at (618) 468-4123 or access@lc.edu. Center for Access and Accommodations is located in Fobes 1523.X

# The Good Life

I have found it difficult to explain to a seven year old why he shouldn't kill mobs in minecraft. Although this particular seven year-old will refrain from killing mobs in Minecraft because he trusts my judgement, and so that when I say "don't kill mobs", he will generally say "okay, I won't, but why?" This is where I find it difficult to come up with a reason that seems satisfying to myself. Consider deontology: do not kill mobs in minecraft because doing so will be treating them as an object. Well, they are objects aren't they? Consequentialists might point out that we are not hurting anyone. A natural law theorist? Is there a law giver, evolution, natural selection or God that would care? Would God care? Why? Is there are question about natural selection that would preclude the adaptive fitness of individuals who kill mobs in Minecraft? If so, it is not obvious.

## Virtue as a human excellence

According to Martha Nussbaum[@nuss86] the ancient Greeks were obsessed with the worry that what makes a human life good, has nothing to do with the human, and everything to do with luck. It is important to point out that when we say "what makes a human life good", what we mean is what makes it worthy of praise, or admiration.

There are two questions here:

First, when does a person deserve praise? At what point, and why, should we admire a human life? Kyrie Irving declined getting the vaccine, in the United States, owing to our value of autonomy and independence, we might say that Kyrie Irving is admirable. For instance, Irving deserves praise for living his life on his own terms. That he exercised his rights, 'his body his choice'. But at the same time, Pat Tillman made a choice to sacrifice his body. So while Irving deserves praise for exercising his bodily rights, Tillman deserves praise for giving up his rights.

Second, which aspects of this praise belong to the person, and which to the circumstances? It wasn't Tillman's fault that there was a war. So Tillman deserves praise because of the war, but what about the person who does not deserve praise because there wasn't a war?

1. The first concerns the role in the human good life of activities and relationships that are, in their nature, especially vulnerable to reversal.

* friendship
* love
* political activity
* attachments to property or possessions

What is the role of these items in a good life, if one can easily loose these because of chance?

2. The relationship among these external goods

* Do they exist harmoniously?
* Can they impair goodness of an agent's life?
* Can they generate conflicting requirements?
  * E.g., can love cause someone to betray a friendship?

3. Self-suffiency, what is the ethical value of our appetites, feelings, and emotions, passions and sexuality?

* Does the value of Self-suffiency outweigh the value of these other *irrational attachments*?
* Do they have value even though they can disrupt our own Self-suffiency? E.g., in rational planning?

## Examples of Fragility and Ambition

### Aeschylus and practical conflict

* What can we learn from tragic poetry and literature?

> But the tragedies also show us, and dwell upon, another more intractable sort of case --- one which has come to be called, as a result, the situation of 'tragic conflict'. In such cases we see a wrong action commetted without any direct physical compulsion and in full knowledge of its nature, by a person whose ethical character or commitments would otherwise dispose him to reject the act.

### Sophocles' Antigon: conflict, vision, and simplification

* In response to what is learned from tragedy, we can simplify our value commitments.

> For the claim is that the human being's relation to value in the world is not, or should not be, profoundly tragic: that it is, or should be, possible without culpable neglect or serious loss to cut off the risk of the typical tragic occurrence. Tragedy would then represent a primitive or benighted stage of ethical life and thought. [51]

### Conclusion to Part I

What have we learned?

* Values taken in the singular are vulnerable
* *Irrational attachments* can disrupt.
* *Irrational attachments* can become grounds of conflict.

But this was an over-ambitious attempt to eliminate luck from human life.

* This shows the importance of human value, *rational choice*. [*tuch$\hat{e}$*]

## Plato: Goodness without fragility

Two problems:

1. Dialogue
2. Development

Some approaches

* lack of response to positive role of vulnerable values in the goodlife
* Plato's insuffienct critique of tragic literature

### The *Protagoras*: a science of practical reasoning

How to develop a *tuche*

* social political techne $\rightarrow$ technai.
* Important: defeated threats from physical environment, but what about the social environment?

How does science save and transform us?

* how do we rank activity independent of the feelings they produce?
* how do we deal with the vulnerability and instability of individual human pursuits?

### Interlude I: Plato's anti-tragic theater

Two ways of dealing with the question about mitigating luck in the social environment:

* Tragic theater: but irrational attachments can disrupt rational choice
* techne (science): but lack of response to positive role of vulnerability in human values

E.g.,

> Here, as in the *Protagoras*, Plato very deliberately creates a speech that will give the impression of not having been deliberately formed. It is not artless; but its art is one that claims to go straight to the truth-telling part of the soul. It is simple rather than flowery, flat rather than emotive or persuasive. [132]

## The *Republic*: true value and the standpoint of perfection

Defends a life of goodness without vulnerability.

Q: What is valuable about a human life?
A: Being invulnerable to luck by quarantining ourselves from irrational attachments.

## The Speech of Alcibiades: a reading of the symposium

> I believe that a deep understanding of the *Symposium* will be one that regards it not as a work that ignores the pre-philosophical understanding of *er$\acute{o}$s*, but as one that is all about that understanding, and also about why it must be purged and transcended, why Diotima has to come once again to save Athens from a plague. [@nuss86, 167]

How?

> *Eros* is the desire to be a being without any contingent occurrent desires. It is a second-order desire that all desires should be cancelled. This need that makes us pathetically vulnerable to chance is a need whose ideal outcome is the existence of a metal status, an artifact.

To be whole means not having any desires. Yet, we want to be whole, but also to have desires. This conflict however, can only be expressed through experience, *pathonta gnonai*, ***understanding through experience***.

Which is:

* the cognitive activity of imagination
* emotion
* appetitive feelings

But the *Symposium* shows us that desire does have an important function, which is to not only move us towards the good, but guide us as well. (As defended in *The Phaedrus*)

> . . . in people of good nature and training, the sensual and appetitive response is linked with, and arouses, complicated emotikons of fear, awe, and respect, which themselves develop and educate the personality as a whole, making it both more discriminating and more receptive. [@nuss86, 215]

To be moved towards beauty:

* open and receptive
* towards truth
* engrossed in a respect for the other person's choices

# Introduction

We have various faculties which help us to make sense of the world around us. This includes perceptual faculties, for instance when we feel the sun on our skin, we know that we do not need an umbrella at that moment.

Some think that our emotions are a kind of perception. When we feel fear, like when we feel the warmth of the sun, we know that it is possible that danger lurks. But we can also imagine fear. This is helpful, sometimes for planning. We might imagine the fear of being stranded because we did not take enough money on our vacation.

Literary fictions can help us to imagine various emotions. Sometimes imagining emotion is important for morality, imagining what it would be like to loose a loved one because of substance abuse may help us to vote for legislation that makes mental health resources more accessible. But does this mean that there is an obligation to use literary fiction to make us more moral? Do game developers have this obligation? What would it look like if they did?

# Deferential Observance

Sarah @mcgr19 argues that when we adopt the beliefs of others without critically analyzing them first, we are deferring our moral decisions to them. This is no different than a pre-linguistic child adopting the behaviors of those around her. It appears as a form of mimicry. She intends this as a defense of moral testimony. It is natural for us to accept the moral views of others even if we have not critically examined them ourselves. For instance, we often accept the views of experts in various domains as action guiding, as justification for our own views etc. Imagine a younger sibling calling an older sibling in front of his friends. Perhaps the younger sibling has told his friends that the exact position and momentum of sub-atomic particles cannot be known and has called his brother, a physicist at the University of Hawaii to confirm this fact to his friends. For this reason, McGrath defends a view on which moral testimony acts as a kind of deference, no different from observation. Just like we observe others and adopt their moral behaviors, we also act on the assertions, or beliefs of others who are more knowledgeable than us in a given domain. A form of mimesis. Therefore, there is reason to think criticisms against deference assumes cognitivism, that it over intellectualizes the transmission of *moral* knowledge. For instance, what about cases wherein we mimic the behavior of others just because they are admirable for us? We often emulate the actions of others sans reflection.

The problem is that assuming cognitivism fails to appreciate all the ways in which our faculties enables us to recognize the truth of a given moral proposition about the way that the world is. Especially that it neglects the important role that our perceptions play in our moral cognition. What it in effect says is that while we may be incapable of perceiving for ourselves the truth of a given proposition, our apprehension of the given truth by way of testimony or deference is a valid substitute. However, while this may or may not be true in the non-moral realm, I give some reasons to think that there is an asymmetry between the moral and non-moral realms with respect to such claims. We can come to know the truth about the way the world is in more ways than recognized by McGrath and it may be possible that we have an ulterior obligation to do so. For instance, we can come to perceive the truth about a given proposition in the same way that we can perceive the sun shinning on our face. In the next section, I suggest that narrative is a form of moral testimony which fine-tunes those faculties central to moral perception enabling us to better perceive the moral truth of a given moral proposition.

In this chapter, I first articulate McGrath's cognitivism showing that it raises important questions for moral realists. Specifically, I highlight the importance of social networks for our apprehension of the validity of moral truth claims. Next, I develop a view that aligns with McGrath's cognitivism as a kind of social science, recognizing the importance of peer networks. Following this, I argue that these are central to our intuitive notions of right reason. In the chapter following, I argue that the kind of reasons which we look for in right action are a special kind of sensitivity to the plight of others.

## A Theoretical Approach to Moral Realism

Is there a theoretical science of ethics and does the domain have its own experts? In what follows, I consider reasons in favor of this position and some that give us reason to reject it. Finally, I argue that the strongest reason for rejecting this view lies in the position that unlike non-moral domains, moral claims are always actionable with respect to those other than one's self.

> In one given case, a man defers to his wife because he believes that she knows the correct *theory* of morality, and that it is her application of this theoretical knowledge that allows her to judge correctly on particular occasions. In another, the wife simply judges, in the manner of a would-be Aristotelian *phronimos*, that such-and-such an action is the thing to be done in the circumstance. Sam adopts these judgments as his own.

There are several ways to contrast moral and non-moral domains with respect to particularism. It is not always the case that scientific disciplines are defined perfectly by boundaries. For instance, while physics and medicine do define distinctive scientific disciplines, they are largely ordered according to the same laws. The law of gravity effects both planetary objects and cochlear fluid. Further, an expert understands how to apply the laws relevant to their domain. While one may be an expert in a given moral domain, it is possible that different moral domains are also governed by the same laws. Such an individual does not need to have a better grasp of those laws, just the applicability of them in a given particular.

If realism is true, then moral inquiry is an attempt to discover moral facts and the proper aim of moral judgment is to depict or represent them correctly, perhaps by correctly detecting their properties. The judgment, *Murder is wrong*, is a representation of a given action. When one morally judges correctly, this just means to say that they have correctly identified the property of wrongness on a given action or behavior. Perhaps there may be a worry that this commits us to moral realism. There are moral facts as evidenced by our emotional experiences. For instance, a standard utilitarian argues that the good is what maximizes happiness, an emotion. Therefore we might think that our emotions could not exist without moral properties. 'Compassion is Good' is a true fact which does not depend on our emotions, rather our emotions depend on this fact. "The term 'realism' is sometimes reserved for a kind of mind-independence: the fact that *a* is *F* is real, on this interpretation, if *a*'s being *F* does not depend on our regarding *a* as *F*'" [@prin07, 14]. But this only specifies external realism. A internal realist may say that *compassion is good* depends on our regarding *compassion as good*. E.g., see @putn82. Some sensibility theories fit the internalist view by equating moral properties with secondary qualities.^[See @darw92; @mcdo13; and @wigg87c.]


### Against the Critical Reflection View {-}

According to the standard account of non-moral justification, if our beliefs are justified, then they are based on adequate grounds and lack sufficient overriding reasons against them. According to Thomas @scan14, moral reasons are fundamentally grounded in desire in that they give an agent non-reducible reasons for acting in some way. Here, it is true that some agent *S* ought not to $\phi$ because *S* has a reason not to $\phi$. This is true in one of two ways: First, either *S* has a reason to do *A* just in case doing *A* would promote the fulfillment of some desire *X* has, or *S* has a reason to do *A* if doing *A* would promote the fulfillment of a desire that *X* would have if *X* were fully aware of the relevant non-normative facts and thinking clearly. Therefore reasons are reasons for a person if that person has the relevant desire or would have the relevant desire if fully informed and thinking clearly.

For McGrath however, the desire is not central. According to the critical reflection view on this account, if one is critically reflective of a given belief and just in case one may have adequate grounds to hold the view, then the moral belief is justified. Mary, Sue and Clarice may be justified on the assumption that they fulfilled their obligations in gathering evidence to support their belief about the importance of inoculation. Once they have considered all the plausible reasons against holding that belief, then their belief lacks sufficient overriding reasons against it and they would be justified in assenting to it.

The activity of justifying one's belief, is the activity of an agent identifying a set of judgments she has, 'genocide is morally impermissible', 'murder is wrong', 'one should not plagiarize'. Typically, one justifying a belief begins by defining concepts and terms that comprise your beliefs. Justice is an important concept related to obligations we have towards one another. When we meet our obligations towards one another, we are acting justly. Murder is unjust killing meaning that murder represents an instance of failing to meet one's obligations. Genocide constitutes many individual instances of murder such that it amounts to an entire population being unjustly killed. We then justify the claim "genocide is wrong" by pointing out inconsistencies in the alternative view. Genocide is wrong on this account because murder is wrong and genocide is multiple instances of murder.

Therefore, a set of conditions that a belief needs to satisfy to be justified includes the ability to critically reflect on that belief and equilibrium between it and the principles it is grounded in.

According to the standard account, moral understanding is shown by us justifying our moral beliefs in the following way:^[@hill09, 167]

```{.remark}

Follow an explanation of why *p* given by someone else.

```

```{.remark}

Draw *p* from *q*; draw *p\'* (or likely *p\'*) from *q\'* where *p\'* and *q\'* are similar but not identical to *p* and *q*.

```

```{.remark}

Given information *p\'*, give the right explanation *q\'*.

```

Following Rawls and Scanlon, McGrath argues that what we know about the world depends on evidence and this evidence is provided by observation rather than critical reflection.

```{.remark}

Critical reflection refers to the activity of justifying one's belief.

```

```{.remark}

Therefore, moral testimony just is a form of moral deference

```

Critical reflection refers to the activity of an agent identifying a set of judgments she has, genocide is morally impermissible, murder is wrong, one should not plagiarize. She then attempts to formulate a set of general principles which account for her judgments. She might argue, for instance, that murder is wrong because it undermines the autonomy of moral agents. She then attempts to determine whether her principles are compatible with her judgments, recursively modifying either until they are [@mcgr19 ch. 2, also see @scan14, 76--77]. We defer all the time in non-moral cases. We often attribute knowledge regardless of whether the knower appreciates why a moral claim is true (against the critical reflection view) and therefore a moral knower does not need to appreciate why a moral claim is true.

On such views, one's knowledge is primarily grounded in her ability to engage in critical reflection. For us to acknowledge that another has knowledge, we must access whether the other is able to demonstrate her ability to critically reflect on her claims or show us that she has done so. If a friend tells us that we should not harm a fly, but is unable to ground this judgment in a principle that they also hold, for instance "harming is wrong", we would not recognize their belief "harming the fly is wrong" as knowledge. Accordingly, there are times wherein our ability to critically reflect on a given claim is undermined by environmental factors. Such factors can include for instance, the death of a loved one causing extreme emotional instability, a real and present danger such as a gunman in our home, or perhaps significant depression etc.

The problems McGrath finds in this account are as follows. For one, it does not account for a lot of our knowledge about the world. For instance, we do not need to critically reflect on our beliefs about feeling the sun's rays on our skin to know that the sun is shining. Similarly, we do not need to reflect on the fact that some actions seem morally right while others wrong. However, moral perceptions differ in an important way from non-moral perceptions. For instance, is it also the case that environmental factors can undermine one's moral knowledge? For instance, consider claims such as generational poverty make it more likely that a felon would be a repeat offender.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether moral perceptions unlike non-moral ones can be highly context dependent. During stressful moments, a harmless joke may seem incredibly insensitive. As such, moral perceptions can be amenable to change, but this does not mean that non-moral perceptions are less so. Although it would be odd to think that the sun is more harsh on one's skin because of the loss of a loved one, it can be that the sun is less tolerable given the loss of a loved one. While it may feel perfectly just to young Mary to deny credence to Sam's testimony given his less than perfect command of the English language, older Mary can look back on her young self with regret and remorse for her beliefs back then. Mary has developed moral understanding, and therefore xenophobia no longer feels right to her.

However, this could also be achieved through observation. The fact that I am blinded by the sun's rays when I open my bedroom curtain is a sufficient overriding reason against my belief that it is still night out. Further, my perception that the sun is shinning is direct. Direct perception then is an adequate ground to hold a given belief. Mary, Sue, and Clarice can be overwhelmed by the force of an argument in favor of inoculation. But what this shows us, is that to suppose that our judgments need to correspond with held principles is too stringent of a demand as it does not explain all that we know. For instance, our beliefs that there is an external world or that the sun is bright. We have some beliefs which are voluntary and others which are involuntary. Both are justified, once we have satisfied all of our epistemic obligations regarding them.

```{.remark}

Believing that *p* in a way that is good from an epistemic point of view satisfies the chief desiderata for a concept of epistemic justification.

```

Having these beliefs signifies that we have *done* something to show *'that p'* or that we are justified in believing *'that p'*. We might recognize that the believing subject has not violated any epistemic, cognitive, or intellectual obligations which may include refraining from believing *'that p'* in the absence of sufficient evidence, accepting implications of the belief *'that p'*, etc. But we have many more beliefs which are involuntary, and these we treat the same as we do the justified beliefs. Though it is plausible, I would be hard pressed to disbelieve that the traffic light is green.

As such, it would seem that whatever concept of justified beliefs we hold under the critical reflection view, it is too stringent to explain much of the knowledge we are supposed to have. Therefore, given that many of our beliefs are involuntary, that I have hands for instance, we often are thought to have fulfilled our obligations with respect to such beliefs. Following this, McGrath then points out that what this means, is that we often act as though being justified is a more important epistemic state than is the state of justifying. Being justified is being in a state of knowledge and while we do think of justification as important, a different path to justification rests on what we know.

```{.remark}

Knowing entails justified believing in that knowing a proposition, e.g. 2+2=4, satisfies the necessary conditions for justification, adequacy and safety.

```

```{.remark}

If S knows *p* then S's belief that *p* is based on adequate grounds and lacks sufficient overriding reasons to the contrary.
```

```{.remark}

But justified belief then, often occurs well before one is able to reflect on what they know or other methods of justification.

```

```{.remark}

Therefore, by the time a typical moral agent is capable of the kind of reflection or other justifying devices necessary for knowledge acquisition, she already has a substantial amount of justified moral beliefs [@mcgr19, ch. 2; also see William @alst89; and C.F. @pryo00].

```

In the traditional arrangement, beliefs meet various criteria including justification and truth for starters. Knowing first means that prior to belief, an agent already possesses knowledge that justifies the belief. We would think that having knowledge, knowing for instance *that p* means that whatever grounds we were previously looking for, are present already prior to cognitive states such as belief or justification. Knowing is a basic form of cognitive access to the world. On the critical reflection view then,

```{.remark}

A moral belief *M* counts as knowledge *mK* for moral agent *S* just in case *M* is the result of critical reasoning or deliberation performed by *S*.

```


However, we often credit an agent with knowledge by the time she is capable of the kind of critical reasoning required under the critical reflection view. In this case then, many of our justified beliefs derive from a kind of perception. I know that the sun is shinning because I can perceive that it is shinning. I am having a given perception that happens before critical reflection. Therefore direct perception is one source of knowledge.

Justification regarding moral testimony, in part, depends on whether we can defend our belief on the basis of the testimony we received. We often take testimony as a source of evidence. This is because testimony is a natural source of belief. We think someone should receive a given vaccine if all the leading experts in a given medical field have testified to its efficacy. We often cite various medical reports in defending our medical decisions. Therefore it seems plausible that we can defend our moral beliefs in the same way, what McGrath calls *moral inheritance*.

```{.remark}

Being justified is a more important state than justifying and a justified belief for S is one based on adequate grounds and where S lacks sufficient overriding reasons to the contrary [@alst89].

```

Therefore,

```{.remark}

What justifies is restricted to a subject's perspective

```

### In defense of Moral Inheritance {-}

@mcgr19 defends a social epistemology, according to which, a person's earliest moral views are “inherited from her social environment." We do often rely on another’s testimony when it comes to things we do not know, such as knowing how to get around in an unfamiliar city. This is because knowledge is a communal enterprise, and it is difficult knowing what to do outside these social contexts [@coad94; @leon18]. We are dependent on others for much of what we know morally about the world. We often receive testimony in the same way that we observe facts about our environment. Observation and testimony then are both sources of evidence. Therefore, moral testimony as a form of deference refers to our natural tendency to adopt beliefs held by those around us. The moral beliefs of a given agent are often shared by the members of her community. There are times when there is disagreement, but these cases are typically exceptional. For instance, Martin Luther King may have a different set of moral beliefs from those in his community, but the disagreement is a source of conflict until the conflict is resolved through something like moral equilibrium. Here the moral beliefs of Martin Luther King, and the other members of his community begin to converge. What is important here, is that the moral conflict is not in a community, but shows a split between communities. Martin Luther King's community is still the source of his moral beliefs, for instance the Ebenezer Baptist Church pastored by his father Martin Luther King Sr.

There are two questions in particular that may help us to understand what is strange about unquestioningly adopting the moral views of others. To understand these, it will be helpful to understand the contexts in which they are important. First, we should not confuse questions about whether we should accept another's testimony, with the observation that we often do. It can be unproblematic that we accept a friend's directions to the stadium because we often defer in non-moral testimonial cases. An example of this is apparent when we are in an unfamiliar city or other kind of setting. Similar to other instances of testimonial transmission cases, a child who learns the capitals of various cities and states as a part of her primary education, is treated as though she possesses a distinctive kind of knowledge, namely the capitals of various states and cities. She obtains this knowledge primarily because she accepted the testimony of her parents or older siblings. That Cheyenne is the capital of Wyoming for instance.

McGrath then argues that in non-moral contexts, we are “prepared to sweepingly defer to others about what to do in particular cases. This is true even when we do not suspect that they have some general theoretical knowledge that we lack” [@mcgr19, 77]. But there is a difference between moral and non-moral cases. We might think that there is no theoretical science of ethics while there is a theoretical science of other fields. We will go to a physicist for questions about gravitational waves but an epidemiologist for questions about vaccine efficacy. Who could we defer to in cases of moral belief? There are some reasons why we might think that moral cases are analogous. I.e., moral particularism, one may be an expert in particular cases only. We may talk to a relationship expert when unsure of what to do to improve our relationship with family members. In such cases however, theoretical, broad sweeping knowledge, is unnecessary.

## Social Reflection

Social epistemologists often question whether some individuals can have a better grasp on the moral particulars of a given social order, or given the current social environment, than others. Someone might know what to do relative to others, when conflicts arise among members of a given culture for instance. The concern here is that someone may strictly rely on another's testimony for their own moral views in a given context only. But while one action may be right in one context but not another, it is still possible that there is a general theory of rightness that explains why an action is the right one in one context but the wrong one in another.

Consider a case by Karen @jone99. Peter lives in a cooperative house. Lately he has been feeling uneasy about the various decisions being made. In one case, the women in the home had withheld their support for several member applicants on the basis of sexism. Peter wanted to understand their allegations but was unable pick out the exact instances in question. Although with some cases when the allegations were explained more carefully to him, he was able to understand the accusations, he was never able to see the evidence for himself. He was never able to point out specific instances without a careful explanation of why a certain look or tone of voice was deemed sexist [59--60].

Epistemic standpoint theorists such as @jone99; @coll02; @sain20; @long02; @hekm97; have given us some reasons in defense of such views. For instance, some individuals have a better appreciation of, or are better able to recognize some moral facts because of their epistemic standing in society or their own personal experiences. Such sensitivity confers moral worth onto an agent\'s action and while they may or may not think that the sensitivity in question cannot come by way of moral testimony, the problem with some accounts is that they fail to recognize the importance of moral knowledge for moral understanding.^[E.g., see @hill09.] However, there are some accounts that provide room to go into this direction: "Reliably acting rightly is a part of having a good character, of course, but a good, virtuous person is someone whose whole self---her thoughts, decisions, feelings, and emotions as well as her actions---is structured by her sensitivity to morality" [@hill09, 112]. Perhaps some of the confusion can be found in the possibility that these seemingly contradict this view: "Understanding is often associated with certain sorts of feeling: a flash of enlightenment; a light drawing. But these are not necessary . . ." [@mcgr19, 103]. Perhaps the confusion consists in the fact that while one can recognize both moral and non-moral feeling: ". . . respect for others can be a feeling which is not explicitly moral" [@mcgr19, 109], they may diverge some from the standard account. A point I worry about throughout this section, is whether feeling is distinctively important for moral consideration. This is perhaps what Scanlon hopes to show in his defense of irreducible normative reasons. This is because understanding requires more than knowledge or true belief in the way of cognitive appreciation of and facility with a given proposition--related reasons and reasoning [@call18d, 441], which for Scanlon are grounded in desire.

### Social Testimony {-}

Because reasons are irreducibly normative, moral testimony should motivate such reasons. Narratives have often been supposed to do just this. However, there are initially some points that should be stressed first.  I suspect that some falsehoods are even more problematic than those often presented in narratives of virtue. Compare an individual with malevolent intentions falsely portraying members of a community that he dislikes with an individual with benevolent intentions falsely portraying members of a community he likes. The one accentuates more positive components of their character in order to disguise more negative ones while doing the opposite for members of communities he dislikes. Fans of a certain sports team may falsely portray fans of the opposing team at a sporting event. Perhaps regardless of the intentions of the one portraying falsehoods, some falsehoods cause harm while others elevate.

One available explanation as to why some inaccuracies are more harmful than others, is that when maligning others, we think that we have an obligation to be as truthful as possible. This is because the harms here outweigh the benefits. We are harming a particular person. In the virtuous narrative, the benefits provided by moral education outweigh the harms of inaccuracy with respect to the truth. As such, there are two kinds of inaccuracy in the narrative. One concerns the inaccurate narrative of the malicious individual attempting to harm others, while another seeks to represent reality. They lie (or embellish the truth) in order to communicate some aspect of moral reality that would be difficult or impossible to do without such embellishments. [Examples]

This suggests that narrative accounts have an obligation to faithfully represent the landscape in a way dis-analogous to narratives of non-normative facts about the real world [E.g., @nuss83], facts such as the chemical composition of pool cleaner for instance. But we are still concerned with facts. As such, truth, faithfulness and accuracy are still requirements for representing the moral landscape. But this says nothing about our emotional responses. Our emotional responses to fiction aid in our moral understanding of a moral proposition. If an audience member is unhappy with the emotion prescribed by an artist, she declines engaging with that work of art. Even more damning for my argument, is the fact that sentimental optimists accept this conclusion. Only some literature is a source for moral knowledge. Accordingly, while some literature is a source for moral knowledge with the potential to undermine knowledge about moral reality, this is not the case for all literature. The rest is merely a-moral.

Similarly, relying on testimony in a range of situations confers justification to one’s belief of a proposition. In a robust sense for example, when a child obtains true beliefs from a reliable source, for instance in primary education, we credit her with knowledge [e.g. @mcgr19, 65]. Similarly, the student who sits through forty hours of lecture on thermonuclear astrophysics has more justified beliefs about thermonuclear astrophysics than the student sits through five. However, the main reason for relying on moral testimony is not primarily to confer justification, to justify her beliefs, but rather to motivate behavior. To potentially be trusted with the kinds of finances required for testing one's theories regarding thermonuclear astrophysics, a behavior, requires additional lecture hours in addition to a proven research record. There are several reasons for this. The person who holds justified non-moral beliefs on a topic, confirms or disproves the beliefs of others. Our own beliefs are justified by those who have justified beliefs, or who possess a greater degree of justification. Therefore, relying on justification to confirm that our moral belief is the correct one, leaves a lot to be desired.  As such, the epistemic state that we care about in cases of moral testimony is understanding and not knowledge. The point of contention here is a difference between the epistemic state of knowledge and the one of understanding.  Knowledge is knowing that p, that a given proposition is true or false, while understanding is knowing that p and why p is the case. This is perhaps a reason why a number of authors recognize a deep connection between narratives and moral knowledge [@nuss90; @stum10]. We may think that what these authors mean by moral knowledge, is a richer state of understanding.

Additionally, authors have argued that the connection between narrative and moral knowledge has to do with a narrative’s ability to express important moments in a character’s emotional and moral development [@stum10; @nuss83; @nuss85, @nuss01; @arpa04; @zagz17; @harr11; @dol18]. Mr. Jones is an FBI operative tasked with observing and reporting on the activities of Mr. Smith, who is suspected of robbing a bank. Accordingly, Mr. Jones is being asked to give a first person account of the life and actions of Mr. Smith. Such accounts would clearly state that the observations being performed, are being done by Mr. Jones. "I, Mr. Jones, have observed the suspect, Mr. Smith, on the morning of ...". But assuming that Mr. Smith has been brought in for questioning, the detective on the case, wants more information than that which can be provided by Mr. Jones. If Mr. Smith chooses to be cooperative, then the detective may want to know *why* Mr. Jones robbed a given bank on a given day. While Mr. Jones may be able to give his assessment as to Mr. Jones' motives, he would not be able to do so in the same way as Mr. Smith. While Mr. Jones can give a first person account of Mr. Smith's motives, and a third person account, for instance "Mr. Smith told me . . .", he cannot give a second personal account as a matter of reporting. Such accounts would provide Mr. Smith with an awareness of Mr. Jones as a rational or not sort of agent. Such an account from Mr. Smith would enable reciprocal understanding of the other's moral autonomy.^[See @darw13c]

Narratives can be a source of second personal knowledge where through narratives, we develop close relationships with characters in narratives [@stum10, 78]. We might think this is plausible assuming that a narrative has an ability to represent these important moments contributing to our sense of familiarity with them. Perhaps we then grow along with the individual through the narrative. We experience moments of hardship and joy, and other defining moments which often contribute to our understanding of the world as potentially experienced by that character. It is not immediately clear what this has to do with moral understanding of a given moral proposition. The standard argument is that narratives are a form of moral education. However, this connection spans two separate concerns. First, there is the less controversial worry about moral testimony as a source for moral knowledge [@hill09; @hopk07; @nick01; @enoc14]. However, this can lead to questions about the perceived relationship between art and ethics, an issue that is more contentious [@gilm20].

While Stump suggests that we can understand narratives as a source of moral knowledge, the psychological implications, the processes involved, are not immediately clear. For such an account to develop beyond folk psychology, it will be helpful to distinguish between several psychological accounts of moral development. On another similar account regarding second-personal testimonies, @nuss01 has defended an interpretation of Greek tragedy wherein the project of Greek tragedy is that it enables us to get a sense for just how fragile a good human life is. Ultimately, Nussbaum concludes that the most important feature of a good human life are our relationships with other persons. According to Nussbaum, tragedy as a form of narrative is important for its ability to communicate this intrinsic feature of a good human life. For instance, in Pindar’s version of Aeschylus’s Agamemnon, when Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter to meet his obligations to Zeus, he does so without any sense of the emotions we would expect one to have in a similar situation. As such, Agamemnon fails to recognize the moral conflict Zeus’ demands have placed on him, the moral conflict undergirding his competing obligations to Zeus and Artimus. While narratives are often thought to communicate the emotions experienced by a character second-personally, in this telling of Agamemnon, narratives express what it would feel like when important emotions are vacant.

What is attractive about narrative is that it gives us insight into what communities plausibly care about, thereby helping us to understand what we may care about. Oftentimes, when we think about psychological disorders, one trait that many of them have in common is that they undermine the sense of connection that we may experience with other members of a close community of people. For instance, individuals with various mental health differences, may often lack recognizable expressions of empathy, and as a result, experience social isolation, or fail to show markers of human connection, such as eye contact. The point here is that our ability to share the perceptions of others may make up an intrinsic part of who we are as a species, the relationships that we cultivate with one another.

For instance, works geared towards pleasure as @gilm20 argues, are not intended for moral knowledge and therefore it is a matter of controversy whether they are unable to undermine moral knowledge. If the work is particularly morally problematic, then perhaps the author or audience is culpable, i.e., Birth of a Nation, but not the work. Importantly here however, there are many ways in which culpability of the audience can be absolved. Perhaps a certain segment of the audience is only interested in the historical facts surrounding Birth of a Nation, or the aesthetic qualities of the film, perhaps another segment of the audience is interested in the technology which led to the creation of the film. But the worry here is that on some level, there is a market value for such films which justifies their place in the market.

To fix this, I suggest that narratives be defined as any work which represents human emotion in the context of human other relationships. Additionally, I will go on to show that an ethics of care will provide the best framework for understanding the importance of narratives for moral knowledge. I argue that on an ethics of care account, a systematic way to recognize moral frameworks in narratives is modeled on a sentimentalist ethics. This enables us to recognize moral testimony as a source of moral knowledge in a way other ethical theories are incapable of. Such accounts of moral testimony necessarily include narratives and therefore on an ethics of care account of moral testimony, narrative is an important source of moral knowledge not recognized in the literature as a kind of moral testimony.

In the following section, I argue that the asymmetry of moral testimony is really a question about whether or not testimony confers morally worthy affective states. In the second section, I further expand on this idea using literary examples showing the importance of affective states in moral reasoning and how without appropriate affect, something is missing in moral action. Because of the importance of affective states in moral reasoning, and how narratives are supremely important for showing this relation, I continue the following section by looking at relationships between narratives and morally worthy actions. I start by looking at a specific conversation between those who think that our emotions towards fictions are governed by the same criteria as our emotions towards situations in the real world, and those who disagree. Without declaring a side, I continue the next section by further highlighting some reasons in favor of each view. In the final section, I develop a model which highlights important aspects of moral knowledge in narrative accounts.

# Conclusion

Questions about country musicâ€™s practical value is important in that it highlights the practical value of music more generally. In this way, we can understand popular songs as a kind of master narrative. Further, it can then be important to understand less popular ones, those free from the coercive effects of the entertainment industry as a whole, we might think of as alternative narratives. Other concerns may also be raised such as the role between culture and behavior regulation. Importantly, what needs to be asked is whether projects such as cultivating a certain identity can be important or even necessary and what role popular music plays in this. One way to understand such questions is through a neo-Aristotelian focus on human vulnerability and the good life.

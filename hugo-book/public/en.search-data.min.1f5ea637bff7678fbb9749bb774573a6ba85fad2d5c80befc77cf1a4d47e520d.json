I always thought that it was a cool concept and unlike any game I had heard of or played. I should inform the viewer however that I am not truly a gamer. What I mean by this statement, is that you, as my audience should take my claim: \u0026ldquo;unlike any game I have heard of or played\u0026rdquo; with a grain of salt. I do not have much experience. In fact, though other members of my family, namely from a previous generation (and namely exactly one) were quite early adopters of \u0026ldquo;gaming culture\u0026rdquo;, my most immediate family members were quite sceptical of anything having to do with the nature of play and make-believe. Video games, comic books, Dungeons and dragons, etc.\nRegardless of all that however, here we are. Where are we you might ask? In a simulated environment that some call a scam and others call the most ambitious project to date. Is Star Citizen a scam or a game? I personally hope that it isn\u0026rsquo;t either. What do you call a virtual environment with numerous mini games inside of it? Do games contain games? What is a game and are there normative criteria defining what counts as a game? How many nested goals should a game contain? Eve Online, another simulated environment replete with mini games could contain an answer for us. While some may be caught up in buying and selling, trading and manufacturing, others could very well get lost in the enumerable systems containing thousands of potential victims to their genocidal ideations.\nGames are a kind of artifact in this sense, at least they might be and that\u0026rsquo;s what we are here to figure out. What better place to start than in the UAE universe, more specifically, the Stanton system. Each week (Ambitious, I know. But a guy can dream can\u0026rsquo;t he?) I will upload a reading to the associated \u0026ldquo;course\u0026rdquo; website. These will be various readings on game theory, design, literary theory, cultural studies, etc, all having to do with video games. At least that is how we will apply these readings. Star Citizen will be the context.\nOn the left of this page is a list of links. Look for one that sounds interesting to you, click on it and give it a pick. You could also continue with this one which is merely some notes on readings in the philosophy of play genre. This is otherwise known, or is a grounding for the philosophy of videogames literature. Except I will spend most of the time talking about Star Citizen which is either a scam, a simulator, or the best most ambitious videogame to date. My kids hate it but they can\u0026rsquo;t look away when I play it. I consider this a win.\nMany of the material here are incomplete ramblings. Hopefully they are complete enough to transmit some kind of meaning regardless of how opaque. The intent is to be able to communicate something that motivates conversation. Oh yeah, and you can leave comments below each. Just please don\u0026rsquo;t cuss me out because my kids may be reading over my shoulder.\n“What are we doing when we play a game?” ( Nguyen, 2017, p. 1) ( pdf)\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/materials/on-narrative/sche-view-from-everywhere/","title":"Sche View From Everywhere","section":"On Narrative","content":" The View from everywhere: temporal self-experience and the Good life # “I agree with Velleman that our experience is inherently multi-perspectival but argue that there are more than two relevant perspectives and reject the claim that these perspectives have independent interests.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nThere are two ways of trying to measure well-being. On the first, the well-being of a life is measured by an accumulation of all of the moments of that life. One way to understand this is by looking, for instance, at consecutive moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life, and determining how, when the person looks back, they feel.\nOn the other, we look at individual moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life. Each moment cannot be compared to another. Momentary experiences can outweigh the total sum.\n“Expanding his metaphor of narrative, I describe the way in which these perspectives continuously influence and affect one another, and suggest that living well can be understood in terms of skillful management of the perspectives that make up this complex form of temporal self-experience.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nSchechtman argues instead, there are two perspectives of measurement.

Can look at Elaine Fox (2008) “Emotion Science.” Discusses what scientists have learned about the emotions. Copp (2007) talks about morality in terms of emotions, beliefs and rules. Part 1:\nAll emotion involves imagination [1]. Imagination involves representing something to ourselves [8]. Because of imagination, we can “see” anything. Our emotions inspire us to search for actions that will address particular problems which we face. But we must make sure to distinguish between emotion and mood. e.g., emotions have objects whereas moods do not. Our emotions put pressures on our thoughts, desires, conjectures, fantasies, and perceptions. This pressure in turn is interpreted as a feeling. There are different categories of emotion understood as a four way distinction between emotion and mood. A way to understand this, is by understanding our emotions as a two-way cross-cutting distinction between passions and sentiments and another between moods and emotions [48]. mood and passion mood and sentiment emotion and passion emotion and sentiment "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/example/","title":"Example Site","section":"Docs","content":" Introduction # Ferre hinnitibus erat accipitrem dixi Troiae tollens # Lorem markdownum, a quoque nutu est quodcumque mandasset veluti.

Other moral foundations theories look at other factors of morality. For instance, the extra Moral Foudations Dictionary According to the ethical theory morality as cooperation, humans over time have faced a number of problems necessitating the need for cooperation. In response to these needs, we have developed various methods for cooperation that act as solutions to these problems. As the theory continues, across all societies, we can identity traits that evolved in humans in light of these needs. The forms these evolved characteristics take are cooperative behaviors that resemble: character traits, strategies, dispositions, behaviors, rules, norms, institutions, and technologies.\n@curr16 has argued there are seven:\nfamily values Kin selection explains why we love and care for our families, why parents feel a duty of care to their offspring, why we feel a special obligation to help our extended families, and why we abhor incest (Hamilton, 1964; Lieberman, Tooby, \u0026amp; Cosmides, 2003).\ngroup loyalty Mutualism explains why we coordinate our activities to pursue projects of mutual interest, why we form groups, clubs, and coalitions (there is strength and safety in numbers), why we value these groups, their members, and our membership in them, why we adopt local norms and conventions, why we feel a special obligation to come to the aid of group members, and why we value loyalty, unity and solidarity (Lewis, 1969; Royce, 1908).\nreciprocity Social exchange explains why we seek opportunities for mutually-beneficial trade, and why we feel we ought to trust others, return favours (positive reciprocity), keep promises, pay debts, fulfil contracts, be grateful for favours received, feel guilty for favours not returned, avenge injuries (negative reciprocity), punish cheats, apologise for causing injuries, and forgive those who apologise (Cosmides \u0026amp; Tooby, 2005;Trivers, 1971).\nheroism defense Conflict resolution explains why we minimise the mutual costs of disputes by engaging in ritual contests: why we proudly display cues of power and high status (‘excellences’, including bravery and generosity); and, when bested, why we express humility, and respect, defer, and submit to our superiors (Curry, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2017).\nfairness Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes over divisible resources by dividing or sharing them (often resulting in equal shares), and hence why we feel an obligation to negotiate, seek a compromise, and be fair (Messick, 1993; Skyrms, 1996).\nproperty rights Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes by recognising prior possession, hence why we feel we ought to respect others’ property and territory, and refrain from theft (Gintis, 2007).\nThe morality as cooperation view predicts that there will be the same number of types of morality as there are of cooperation (Curry et al, 2019b). They test this hypothesis using a content analysis of 600 ethnographic accounts of 60 societies chosen at random from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF). Alfano predicts that they can use natural language processing, more specifically the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count method developed by @penn2015 [Also see @penn2011] to test this hypothesis rather than the hand code holographic method (Otterbein 1978; Ember and Ember 2009) used by Curry et al. LIWC combs through a text and counts the number of words belonging to a given category. For instance, LIWC has been used to count the number of first person pronouns, psychological processes such as positive and negative emotions, and discreet emotions. LIWC relies on a given dictionary provided by the user which instructs what kinds of words to be counted.\nMoral corpora is typically used by LIWC users to count moral terms using the Moral Foundations Dictionary [MFD], for instance Hoover et all use MFD to comb tweets for 5 domains and Padfield and Buchanan (2020) use MFD to characterize the moral lean of US news organizations. However, MFD is limited in a number of ways, not having foundations for family values, reciprocity, heroism, or property rights. In addition, there are interrater reliability issues. Given these issues, Alfano et al created the Morality as Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D).\nFirst they brainstormed words aligning with the seven basic moral principles hypothesized by Curry et al. These include loving your family, being loyal to your group, returning favours, exercising courage and generosity, showing deference to superiors, being fair in the distribution of resources, and respecting property. They next used the software program WordNet, which is a large English language lexical database. When given a word or phase, Wordnet generates synsets that can be used to search related terms according to a given category: synonyms, hyponyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc.\neHRAF eHRAF is an archive of thousands of full text ethnographies (Lagace 1979). Alfano et al also relied on these ethnographic accounts to test the terms in MAC-D. To do so, they extracted 331 paragraphs from eHRAF that were labeled as ethics resulting in 1,620,644 words from 9,653, paragraphs, from 1,389 documents, covering 256 societies, 8 cultural regions, following 9 subsistence strategies. They then used the MAC dictionary to calculate the percentage of words from each paragraph that was found in one or more of the seven foundation dictionaries.\nBuilding a Dataset I have several datasets comprised of Taylor Swift song lyrics. One of these is organized by year. A good question that is available to us using this dataset, is whether there are computationally significant differences between Swift’s earlier songs and more recent ones. One kind of difference we can discern could be whether her moral commitments changed according to the MAC-D. For instance, does she make more references to family values in her earlier stuff than she does her later.\nswift_l \u0026lt;-

you, I run and run Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides Look now, the sky is gold I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home I dont know why all the trees change in the fall But I know youre not scared of anything at all Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away But I know I had the best day with you today Im thirteen now And dont know how my friends could be so mean I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay But I know I had the best day with you today I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger God smiles on my little brother, inside and out Hes better than I am I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run And I had the best days with you There is a video I found from back when I was three You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves Daddys smart And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world Now I know why all the trees change in the fall I know you were on my side even when I was wrong And I love you for giving me your eyes For staying back and watching me shine And I didnt know if you knew, so Im taking this chance to say That I had the best day with you today 8 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;willow (dancing witch version) Lyrics Im like the

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong . An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession . A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize . Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line . My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942 . A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve Now its up to you to pass them down Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dorothea Lyrics Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?

So you could sit there in this hurt Bustling crowds or silent sleepers Youre not sure which is worse Because I dropped your hand while dancing Left you out there standing Crestfallen on the landing Champagne problems Your moms ring in your pocket My picture in your wallet Your heart was glass, I dropped it Champagne problems You told your family for a reason You couldnt keep it in Your sister splashed out on the bottle Now no ones celebrating Dom Perignon, you brought it No crowd of friends applauded Your hometown skeptics called it Champagne problems You had a speech, youre speechless Love slipped beyond your reaches And I couldnt give a reason Champagne problems Your Midas touch on the Chevy door November flush and your flannel cure This dorm was once a madhouse I made a joke, Well, its made for me How evergreen, our group of friends Dont think well say that word again And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls That we once walked through One for the money, two for the show I never was ready so I watch you go Sometimes you just dont know the answer Til someones on their knees and asks you She wouldve made such a lovely bride What a shame shes fucked in the head, they said But youll find the real thing instead Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred Related Songs And hold your hand while dancing Never leave you standing Crestfallen on the landing With champagne problems Your moms ring in your pocket Her picture in your wallet You wont remember all my Champagne problems You wont remember all my Champagne problems 108 Embed ## 3 N/A;Permanent Marker

awake ) But now I see daylight I only see daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight And I can still see it all in my mind All of you, all of me intertwined I once believed love would be black and white But its golden golden And I can still see it all in my head Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed I once believed love

they love you Youre gonna believe them And when youre fifteen, feelin like theres nothin to figure out Well, count to ten, take it in This is life before you know who youre gonna be Fifteen You sit in

fifteen and somebody tells you they love you Youre gonna believe them And when youre fifteen and your first kiss Makes your head spin round But in your life youll do things greater than Dating the boy on the football team But I didnt know it at fifteen When all you wanted was to be wanted Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday But I realized some bigger dreams of mine And Abigail gave everything she had To a boy who changed his mind And we both cried Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you Youre gonna believe them And when youre fifteen, dont forget to look before you fall Ive found time can heal most anything And you just might find who youre supposed to be I didnt know who I was supposed to be At

love look hard The stakes are high, the waters rough But this love is ours You never know what people have up their sleeves Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles But I dont care, cause right now, youre mine And youll say Dont you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the waters rough But this love is ours And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong and Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and Ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos Will be ignored, cause my heart is yours So dont

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong . An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession . A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize . Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line . My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942 . A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve Now its up to you to pass them down Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics I dont like your little games Dont like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I dont like you I dont like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh) But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip . This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you . The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing . When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test.

there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well And there we are again when nobody had to know You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath Sacred prayer and wed swear To remember it all too well, yeah Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up Runnin scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of bein honest Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here Cause I remember it all, all, all They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell Every time you double-cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine And that made me want to die The idea you had of me, who was she? A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin in a party bathroom Some actress askin me what happened, you Thats what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones Im a soldier whos returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? Cause in this citys barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?

Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones When you are young, they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick Sensual politics When you are young, they assume you know nothing But I knew you Dancin in your Levis Drunk under a streetlight, I I knew you Hand under my sweatshirt Baby, kiss it better, I And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed You put me on and said I was your favorite A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one When you are young, they assume you know nothing But I knew you Living in a gold age Sneaking to my bird cage, I I knew you Laughing like a damn fool Breaking every damn rule, I And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed You put me on and said I was your favorite And then, I have like this-- theres like a break, because I dont really know whats gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think its here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. And to kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed You drew stars around my scars Now Im bleedin Im bleedin Well work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, theres all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I dont think its right now, but... there it is. The ending. Cause I knew you Steppin on the last train Marked me like a bloodstain, I I knew you Tried to change the ending Peter leaving Wendy, I I knew you Dancing in your Levis Drunk under a streetlight, I I knew you That when you are young, they assume you know nothing But I knew youd linger like a stolen kiss I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young I knew Id curse you for the longest time I knew Id wish you wouldve changed your mind I knew youd miss me once the moment died I knew to love would be to lose my mind And then, I dont know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, thats just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 2 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Everything Has Changed Lyrics (You good to go?)

New Years Day ] And long live (Please, dont ever become a stranger) The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere) I had the time of my life (Please, dont ever become a stranger) With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere) And long live The walls we crashed through I had the time of my life With you 2 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;The Power of Pop Lyrics My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the characters does. Its something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment. Im highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear Cowboy Take Me Away by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. Im clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear I Write Sins Not Tragedies by Panic! At The Disco, Im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear How to Save a Life by The Fray, Breathe (2AM) by Anna Nalick, or The Story by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When Id get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room - just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Greys Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). Im convinced that You Learn by Alanis Morissette, Put Your Records On by Corinne Bailey Rae and Why by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs. I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when Im writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever. The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. Youd think that as pop writers, were supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so youd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic... AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I dont mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See Love Story, 2009). In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like Kiki, do you love me and Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana. I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, this is what I went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. Its this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book. Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Christmas Must Be Something More Lyrics What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing? Would the song still survive without five golden rings? Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe? What would happen if God never let it snow? What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie? Tell me, what would you find? Youd see that today holds something special Something holy, not superficial So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives Its something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door So heres something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something more What if angels did not pay attention to All the things that we wished they would always do? What if happiness came in a cardboard box? Then I think there is something we all forgot What would happen if presents all went away? Tell me, what would you find? Youd see that today holds something special Something holy, not superficial So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives Its something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door So heres something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something more We get so caught up in all of it Business and relationships Hundred-mile-an-hour lives And its this time of year And everybodys here It seems the last thing on your mind Is that the day holds something special Something holy, not superficial So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives Its something we all try to ignore And put a wreath up on your door But heres something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something Christmas must be something Christmas must be something more Theres gotta be more Theres gotta be more 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Innocent Lyrics I guess you really did it this time Left yourself in your war path Lost your balance on a tightrope Lost your mind trying to get it back Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days?

This is sort of a... its not a short speech, so, just, I dont want this to slip and break, cause its very important to me. Thank you so much. Shes so supportive. We all need someone like that. Im Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for - Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means Ive seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless , and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs Love Story and You Belong With Me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasnt. I saw that people love to explain away a womans success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldnt do is exactly what I did. Huh, Ill take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that Id never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they werent sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldnt understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was A Swift Backlash, which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond peoples comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didnt know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now , and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldnt be. I didnt know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasnt quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics. Theyre saying Im dating too much in my twenties? Okay, Ill stop. Ill just be single... for years. Now theyre saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, Ill make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, theyre saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, heres an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989 . Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now its that Im showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now Im actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, Ill disappear from public view... for years. Now Im being cast as a villain to you? Okay, heres an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, I really like his songs, but I dont know what it is, theres just something about him I dont like. No! That criticism is reserved for us . But, you know, Ive learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. Ive watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized - Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, theyve been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldnt let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess , Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that couldve crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didnt kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A\u0026amp;R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasnt around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, were always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now were able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. Ive spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still dont think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dont you? Lately, theres been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if its an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Brauns Ithaca Holdings in a deal that Im told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group. Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced. Im fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, But hes always been nice to me! when Im raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course hes nice to you. If youre in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could buy me, but Im obviously not going willingly. Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever. But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, Ive seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. Ive seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And Ive seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. Ive leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them. I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that. This speech Im referring to was on my 25th birthday. Im about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her. Ive since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie. And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where peoples dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music. And as for me, lately Ive been focusing less on doing what they say I cant do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. Im honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much. 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;The Man Lyrics I would be complex, I would be cool Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to And that would be okay for me to do Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you Id be a fearless leader Id be an alpha type When everyone believes ya Whats that like?

fell apart in the usual way And the storys got dust on every page But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now And I see your face in every crowd Cause darling, it was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground Tonight, Im gonna dance For all that weve been through But I dont wanna dance If Im not dancing with you Tonight, Im gonna dance Like you were in this room But I dont wanna dance If Im not dancing with you It was good Never looking down And right there where we stood Was holy ground Tonight, Im gonna dance For all that weve been through But I dont

Its weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. Ive heard people say that your thirties are the most fun! So Ill definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought Id share some lessons Ive learned before reaching 30, because its 2019 and sharing is caring. Lesson 1 I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent, how youre failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, Im showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but Im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look . Im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while Im having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think its healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it , especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once. Lesson 2 Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake--only bite if someone steps on you. Lesson 3 Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. Its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. Thats GOOD. Well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. Thats not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe youll learn from it. Then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But its fine; do you, youre searching. Lesson 4 I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day. Lesson 5 Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isnt cruel. Its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it. Lesson 6 Ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we arent allowed to age. Its an impossible standard to meet, and Ive been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men. Lesson 7 My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didnt know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address Ive ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love Ive witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears. Lesson 8 I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isnt real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want. Lesson 9 I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimms cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because...2016. Lesson 10 Ive always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know Ill be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Gartens Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawsons Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Olivers Chicken Fajitas with Mole Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what Im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex.) Lesson 11 Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if Id hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape. Lesson 12 Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, its so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say Im sorry, but... and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships. Lesson 13 Its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying This happened to me. Its something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont. Lesson 14 When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before, its okay to say that you dont know what to say. Sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear. Its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you dont have all the answers. However, its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point. Even if you cant really help the situation, its nice for them to know that you would if you could. Lesson 15 Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy. Lesson 16 Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I dont know...get to know someone! All that glitters isnt gold, and first impressions actually arent everything. Its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a solid first 15), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after theyve seen you broken? Or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people? These are things a first impression could never convey. Lesson 17 After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why cant I be soft during all the seasons?! Lesson 18 Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. Its important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them. Lesson 19 Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess. Lesson 20 Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about were in our young twenties! hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. Its sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but youll always keep the memories. Lesson 21 Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you dont look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, youre doing it wrong. See: Bleachella. Lesson 22 How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are youre not trying to hurt the person you love and they arent trying to hurt you . If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, theres a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say Hey, same team. Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They dont give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers. Lesson 23 I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who dont care if Im #canceled. They were there in the worst times and theyre here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. Ill never forget the ones who stuck around. Lesson 24 Ive had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. Its taught me that there are real problems and then theres everything else. My moms cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now. Lesson 25 I remember people asking me, What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy? Theres a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. Im really grateful to have learned this isnt true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool. Lesson 26 I make countdowns for things Im excited about. When Ive gone through dark, low times, Ive always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (theyre free) and adding things Im looking forward to. Even if theyre not big holidays or anything, its good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and its good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things. Lesson 27 I learned that disarming someones petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, Ive come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than Ive ever felt in my life, but I cant tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. Its the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a trolls hateful Instagram comment with lol. It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all Ill ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it. Lesson 28 Im finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. Im going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year. Lesson 29 I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. Its the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, theyve left me. Please pray for their safe return. Lesson 30 My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. Id lock myself in my room and couldnt forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel Ive made a mistake, whether its self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. Ive come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go. 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Our Song (Live from SoHo) Lyrics One, two Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down He says, Baby, is something wrong? I say, Nothing, I was just thinking How we dont have a song And he says Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tapping on your window When were on the phone and you talk real slow Cause its late and your mama dont know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have And when I got home fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again I was walking up the front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong and been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, well on my way To my lovin bed I almost didnt notice all the roses And the note that said Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tapping on your window When were on the phone and you talk real slow Cause its late and your mama dont know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have And when I got home fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again Da da da da Well, Ive heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tapping on his window When were on the phone and he talks real slow Cause its late and his mama dont know Our song is the way he laughs The first date: Man, I didnt kiss him, and I should have And when I got home fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again Play it again Oh yeah Oh oh yeah I was riding shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen and an old napkin And I wrote down our song Thank you so much!

Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that youre reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying...its just coming alive There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently In recent years, youve probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet...is that they all realize their worth and ask for it Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. Its my opinion that music should not be free , and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an albums price point is . I hope they dont underestimate themselves or undervalue their art Arrows Through the Heart In mentioning album sales, Id like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now theyre buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really arent alone in feeling so alone. It isnt as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in peoples lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past However, some artists will be like finding the one. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say shock; I said surprise. I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why cant this love affair exist between an artist and their fans? In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generations artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I havent been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento kids these days want is a selfie. Its part of the new currency, which seems to be how many followers you have on Instagram. Fan Power A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans--not the other way around Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country--and to me, thats incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted...it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all Celebrity Spotlight I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the 70s, 80s and 90s tell me, It was never this crazy for us back then! And I suspect Ill be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to And as for me? Ill just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism And Id also like a nice garden 5 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;You Belong With Me (Taylors Version) Lyrics Youre on the phone with your girlfriend, shes upset Shes going off about something that you said Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do Im in my room , its a typical Tuesday night Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like And shell never know your story like I do Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find That what youre looking for has been here the whole time If you could see that Im the one who understands you Been here all along, so why cant you see? You belong with me, you belong with me Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself Hey, isnt this easy? And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down You say youre fine, I know you better than that Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that? She wears high heels, I wear sneakers Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find That what youre looking for has been here the whole time If you could see that Im the one who understands you Been here all along, so why cant you see? You belong with me Standing by and waiting at your back door All this time how could you not know, baby? You belong with me, you belong with me Oh, I remember you driving to my house In the middle of the night Im the one who makes you laugh When you know youre bout to cry I know your favorite songs And you tell me bout your dreams Think I know where you belong Think I know its with me Cant you see that Im the one who understands you? Been here all along, so why cant you see? You belong with me Standing by and waiting at your back door All this time how could you not know, baby?

Last time I was in a stadium this size, I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard. This outfit is much more comfortable. I would like to say a huge thank you to NYUs chairman of the board of trustees, Bill Berkley, and all the trustees and members of the board, NYUs president Andrew Hamilton, provost Katherine Fleming, and the faculty and alumni here today who have made this day possible. I feel so proud to share this day with my fellow honorees, Susan Hockfield and Felix Matos Rodriguez, who humble me with the ways they improve our world with their work. As for me, Im 90% sure the main reason Im here is because I have a song called 22. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York Universitys Class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasnt easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you, and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you as you asked a bazillion questions, like, How does the moon work? and Why can we eat salad, but not grass? And maybe they didnt do it perfectly -- no one ever can --, maybe they arent with us anymore, in that case, I hope youll remember them today. If they are in this staium, I hope youll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps, and missteps, that have led us to this common destination. I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day, so I could go from singing in coffeehouses to standing up here with you today, because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York, its been waiting for you. Id like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a doctor. Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute. I never got to have a normal college experience, per se. I went to public high school until 10th grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then, I went on the road for radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamourous, but in reality, it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest. As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song Love Story at my fantasy, imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass, and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives. Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right? But I really cant complain about not having a normal college experience to you, because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass, like, a thousand COVID tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted, too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you dont always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what youve done with it. Today, you leave New York University and then go out into the world, searching whats next. And so will I. So, as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice, unless they ask for it. Ill go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please, bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. Youve worked, and struggled, and sacrificed, and studied, and dreamed your way here today, and so you know what youre doing. Youll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So, I wont tell you what to do, cause no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks I wish I knew when I was starting out my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope, and friendship. The first of which is: Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You cant carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so theres more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning. Secondly: Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe, retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime, even the term cringe might someday be deemed cringe. I promise you, youre probably doing or wearing something right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You cant avoid it, so dont try to. For example, I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife. But you know what? I was having fun. Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun. And while were talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldnt, Id like to say Im a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that its not cool to want it; the people who dont try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldnt know, because I am a lot of things, but Ive never been expert on chic, but Im the one whos up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date, and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company. I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then, its been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether its directing videos, or a short film, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas, narrowing them down, polishing it up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out an old idea because you thought of a newer, better one, or a plot device that ties it all together. Theres a reason they call it a hook: Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me and I cant focus on anything until its been recorded or written down. As a songwriter, Ive never been able to sit still or stay in one place for too long. Ive made and released 11 albums and, in the process, Ive switched genre from country to pop to alternative to folk, and this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion, but in a way, I really do think we are all writers. And most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your Instagram stories than you do your senior thesis; you send a different type of email to boss than you do to your best friend from home. We are all literary chameleons and I think its fascinating -- its a continuation of the idea that we are many things all the time. And I know it can be very overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go. I have some good news: Its totally up to you. I have some terrifying news: Its totally up to you. I said to you earlier that I dont ever offer advice unless someone asks for it, and now Ill tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price, and that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings. See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day running off the rails, and that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So, I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didnt make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire Earth would fall off its axis, and it would be entirely fault, and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever. It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life. This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life, and being embarrassed when you mess up is part of the human experience. Getting back up, dusting yourself off, and seeing who still wants to hang out after and laugh about it -- thats a gift. The times I was told no, or wasnt included, wasnt chosen, didnt win, didnt make the cut, looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial than the moments I was told yes. Not being invited to the parties and sleepovers in my hometown made me feel hopelessly lonely, but because I felt alone I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket somewhere else. Having label executives in Nashville tell me that only 35-year-old housewives listened to Country music and there was no place for a 13-year-old on their roster made me cry in the car on the way home. But then Id post my songs on my MySpace -- yes, MySpace -- and I would message with other teens like me who loved country music, but just didnt have anyone singing from their perspective. Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceived me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am. Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and twenties, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely. Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likeability. Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine. I know I sound like a consummate optimist, but Im really not. I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes, everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism. And I know that Im talking to a group of perfectionists because you are here today graduating from NYU. So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didnt deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom, finally address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat. And Im not going to lie, these mistakes will cause you to lose things. Im trying to tell you that losing things doesnt just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too. Now, you leave the structure and framework of school and chart your own path. Every choice you make leads to the next choice, which leads to the next, and I know its hard to know which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is actually to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight. Times when the right thing is to turn and run. Times to hold on with all you have, and times to let go with grace. Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to sit and listen to wisdom to those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You wont. How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices? I wont. The scary news is, youre on your own now. But the cool news is, youre on your own now. I leave you with this: We are led on our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars, and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I, and when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet. Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it, and as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, and breathe out. And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works. I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. Were doing this together, so lets just keep dancing like were the class of 22. 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;this is me trying Lyrics Ive been having a hard time adjusting I had the shiniest wheels, now theyre rusting I didnt know if youd care if I came back I have a lot of regrets about that Pulled the car off the road to the lookout Couldve followed my fears all the way down And maybe I dont quite know what to say But Im here in your doorway I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying They told me all of my cages were mental So I got wasted like all my potential And my words shoot to kill when Im mad I have a lot of regrets about that I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here Pouring out my heart to a stranger But I didnt pour the whiskey I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying At least Im trying And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying (And maybe I dont quite know what to say) I just wanted you to know that this is me trying At least Im trying 77 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;I Wish You Would Lyrics Its 2 AM

stone Some bad directions must have me here by mistake Cause this sure aint what I call home Let me close my eyes for a second See if I can get out of here, and Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun And watch a pickup truck drive by And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here But I dont, I just sit under this tree And Im in Tennessee Standing on a road leading to a barn With a cat named Eloise Later on, well all go fishing in the pond But all well catch is just a summer breeze Let me close my eyes for a second See if I can stay right here, and Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun And watch a pickup truck drive by And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here But I dont, I just sit under this tree And Im in Tennessee When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away I find myself staring at the same old day I need to go back, back to where I feel so free Well, it looks like Im going back to Tennessee I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun And watch a pickup truck drive by And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here But I dont, I just sit under this tree Just me and Eloise And Im in Tennessee Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;If Youre Anything Like Me Lyrics If youre anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when youre nervous. You promise people the world, because thats what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If youre anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If youre anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If youre anything like me, Theres a justice system in your head For names youll never speak again, And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If youre anything like me Youve grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If youre anything like me, You couldnt recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If youre anything like me, Im sorry. But Darling, its going to be okay. 24 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Youre Not Sorry / What Goes Around.../...Comes Around Lyrics All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around Ive been giving out chances every time And all you do is let me down And its taken me this long baby but I figured you out And youre thinking well be fine again But not this time around You dont have to call anymore I wont pick up the phone This is the last straw Dont wanna hurt anymore And you can tell me that youre sorry But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before Youre not sorry, no, no Youre looking so innocent I might believe you if I didnt know Couldve loved you all my life if you didnt leave me waiting in the cold Youve got your share of secrets And Im tired of being last to know And now youre asking me to listen Cause its worked each time before But you dont have to call anymore I wont pick up the phone This is the last straw Dont wanna hurt anymore And you can tell me that youre sorry But I dont believe you, baby, like I did before Youre not sorry, no Youre not sorry, no You had me crawling for you, honey And it never wouldve gone away, no You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade Dont wanna think about it Dont wanna talk about it Im just so sick about it Cant believe its ending this way Im so confused about it Feeling the blues about it I just cant do without ya Wont you tell me, is this fair?

Im not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. Id practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining. But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were. In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love. Ive decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things Im afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but theyre not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didnt. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, its someone who deserves you. If thats the case, I hope you treat them with care. This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (thats why there are so many songs). In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night. We are what we love. This is Lover.

Im watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear: Now Im gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes youll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brendas metal in this song I wish Id wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee. The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and shes looking down at a framed picture. Shes at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. Thats when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is Someone Loves You Honey. The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee. Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock \u0026amp; roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her. I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. Theres a reason shes been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like shes five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, its almost like shes golden.

I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. Its not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I dont know if Im ever gonna feel that way again, but I dont know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasnt losing him, it was losing me. 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ME!

Heres to the moments when weve forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things were insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti. To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you. Heres to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things theyve sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Heres to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Heres to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party. Heres to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes. Heres to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything Ive learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, Ive learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums. Thanks to you, Im doing better than I ever was.

I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries. Im sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. Im not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs. These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call. I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period... even if it is free for the fans trying it out. Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right. But I say to Apple with all due respect, its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We dont ask you for free iPhones. Please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right. Whatever you do, it is not enough. Your kindness is fake. Your pain is manipulative. When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here. And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive. 28 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;So It Goes...

scarf there at your sisters house And youve still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze Were singing in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know its long gone and That magics not here no more And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all Oh, oh, oh Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well, yeah And maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well

air was cold But somethin bout it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sisters house And youve still got it in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze Were singin in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know its long gone and That magics not here no more And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all Oh, oh, oh Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinkin your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys, Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin town And I was thinkin on the drive down, Any time now Hes gonna say its love, you never called it what it was Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well And there we are again when nobody had to know You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath Sacred prayer and wed swear To remember it all too well, yeah Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up Runnin scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of bein honest Im a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin here Cause I remember it all, all, all They say alls well that ends well, but Im in a new hell Every time you double-cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it wouldve been fine And that made me want to die The idea you had of me, who was she? A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin in a party bathroom Some actress askin me what happened, you Thats what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones Im a soldier whos returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? Cause in this citys barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? Just between us, do you remember it all too well? Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare, you remember it all too well Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh) Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there It was rare,

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip . This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you . The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing . When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us . There will be no further explanation . There will be just reputation . 14 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;If Youre Anything Like Me Lyrics If youre anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when youre nervous. You promise people the world, because thats what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If youre anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If youre anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If youre anything like me, Theres a justice system in your head For names youll never speak again, And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If youre anything like me Youve grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If youre anything like me, You couldnt recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If youre anything like me, Im sorry. But Darling, its going to be okay. 24 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;King Of My Heart Lyrics Im perfectly fine, I live on my own I made up my mind, Im better off bein alone We met a few weeks ago Now you try on callin me Baby like tryin on clothes Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, Ive been waiting, waiting Ooh whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once Late in the night, the citys asleep Your love is a secret Im hoping, dreaming, dying to keep Change my priorities The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh) Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do (Where you do) And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once (Hey), Ive been waiting, waiting (Waiting) Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting) Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once Is this the end of all the endings?

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right. Whatever you do, it is not enough. Your kindness is fake. Your pain is manipulative. When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here. And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive. 28 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics I dont like your little games Dont like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I dont like you I dont like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh) But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

in your drawer, even now Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze Were singing in the car, getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know its long gone and That magics not here no more And I might be okay, but Im not fine at all Oh, oh, oh Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well, yeah Well maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all

This may become necessary when attempting to determine how to reconcile our past, current or future behaviors. A way to do so is by determining who we take ourselves to be and calculating what kinds of behaviors are a likely consequence. A popular example is that of someone who seems to remember leading soldiers into battle at Waterloo. But lets further imagine that they were born in 1980 rather than 1780. This is an extreme case however, but there is a more mundane case that can reflect the concern we associate with identity claims.\nLets imagine that for whatever reason, I seem to remember putting my keys on the kitchen counter. However, this memory may conflict with who I believe myself to be. As I have always thought of myself as the kind of self who lives an orderly and regimented life. This means that I keep an orderly home, always placing my items in the places that I designate for them. The kitchen counter is not the kind of place that I have designated for my keys and as such, I cannot reconcile this memory (putting my keys on the kitchen counter) with the kind of self that I take myself to be.\nOn a bodily criterion, identity is established if and only if the body of A is continuous with the body of B. The question being whether my body is the same body as the self that places their keys on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway. If it is, then we have established identity.\nHowever, there are various views that understand the psychological account of continuity as better expressing what we mean by identity. For instance, how do we explain phrases such as it is hard for me to reconcile the person I was with who I am. Or consider questions of legal punishment. We might think a particular inmate deserves clemency because they are no longer the person who committed a given crime. If bodily criterion is the only acceptable criterion for identity, then how do we explain rehabilitation or salvation?\nWhether or not I identify with the sort of personality that places their keys un-reflectively on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway is another way of understanding why the psychological criterion is important. Contemporary philosophical discussion on personal identity is generally concerned with reidentification and not self-knowledge. A look at one of the most prominant views in this area will follow in Section 1.\nTwo opposing views generally have been\nbodily criterion (sameness of body grounds personhood)\npsychological criterion (personality grounds personhood)\nSchechtman criticizes the psychological criterion on account that it does not provide the sort of criterion of personal identity that does not presuppose that same identity.\nI shall argue that psychological continuity does not and cannot provide the sort of criterion of personal identity which identity theorists which to provide.\nThis leads to two related claims. That:\npsychological continuity is circular and that:\nso cannot provide analysis of our concept of the persistence of a person This means that neither bodily criterion can explain identity of a person over time, but neither that the current conceptions of psychological criterion can do so as well.\nSection 1, Parfit’s view # Derek Parfit initially gives a view of identity that does not presuppose identity (reductionist). His view is a good starting point for understanding the psychological criterion and to see why it initially seemed plausible.\nFirst, an identity criterion will\nconsists in holding certain facts\nthese facts can be described without presupposing the identity of the person they belong to\nThe context\nUnderstanding non-reductive identity criterion as:\ngiving an identity criterion that does not employ facts about persons or their identities in its specification For Parfit, these are facts that establish direct psychological connections between:\n- between a memory and the experience - between an intention and an action which carried out the intention - persistence of a belief, desire, or other psychological feature “The Psychological Criterion: (1) There is psychological continuity if and only if there are overlapping chains of strong connectedness. X today is one and the same person as Y at some past time if and only if (2) X is psychologically continuous with Y, (3) this continuity has the right kind of cause, and (4) there does not exist a different person who is also” ( pdf) “psychologically continuous with Y. (5) Personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like (2) to (4) (207).” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 73) ( pdf) ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 72)\nThere is strong psychological continuity: person A, is the same person as B, where A means some individual person at a point in time t1 prior to an individual person B at a time subsequent to t1, say t2. if and only if there are strong overlapping chains of interconnectedness including:\n1. psychological continuance 2. continuity has the right kind of cause 3. there does not exist a different person who is psychologically continuous with *B* 4. and that personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like 1-3. Section 2, The circularity objection and standard response # But, “we can seem to remember experiences which are not ours . . . such seeming memories are no basis for claims of personal identity”\n(2) x is psychologically continuous with y\npresupposition? (3) this continuity has the right kind of cause\nwhat would be the right kind of cause for a memory?\nmemory presupposes “persistence of a single individual”\ngenuine vs delusional memory is defined by identity vs nonidentity intention\naction counts as intended if same person so defined by identity (4) there does not exist a different person who is also “psychologically continuous with y.\nfalse memories would have two different persons that are psychologically continuous with y.\nonly one person if the other has lost their memory of an event\nParfit’s response to this objection is grounded in undefined quasi states.\nquasi memories\nquasi intentions\nThe circularity objection # We can only remember our own experiences\n(1) The fact that we can only remember our own experiences is not [cannot be] the reason why (genuine) memory connectedness is a plausible criterion of personal identity\nYet quasi-memory connectedness will do just as well as genuine memory in specifying an identity criterion\nTherefore, whatever is the reason why genuine memory specifies an identity criterion, is also present in quasi memory\nBut (1 -2), The fact that we can only remember our own experiences [cannot be] the reason why quasi memory connectedness is a plausible criterion of personal identity\nThe nondelusionality of a memory\nits relevance to the constitution of personal identity\nAccording to the circularity objection, memory presupposes personal identity. # However, the examples that are used to underlie this claim, rely on the need to use personal identity to distinguish between delusional and nondelusional memories.\nHow do we prove that genuine memory is nondelusional without presupposing personal identity?\nOne problem is that in answering the above question\ndoes not show us that quasi memories capture what is relevant to personal identity in genuine memory\ncannot be captured without presupposing personal identity\nThe nondelusionality of quasi memory # memory == apparent memory and to correctly take it as being one’s own experience\ndelusion == apparent memory and to incorrectly take it as being one’s own experience\nquasi memory == apparent memory (properly caused) and to hold no view about whose memory it is, so does not reference sameness of person\nBut what is this grounded in? How do we have memories without a view about whose the memory is? Parfit:\nWe do not quasi-remember other people’s past experiences. But we might begin to do so. . . . Suppose that . . . neuro-surgeons develop ways to create in one brain a copy of a memory-trace in another brain. This might enable us to quasi-remember other people’s past experiences\nSection 3, # However,\nParfit does not explicitly define quasi desires, quasi beliefs, or quasi intentions, but he does recognize their importance within his view, and suggests that they can be specified in the same way that quasi memory is\nAlthough quasi states seems like a solution, it is not clear what these states are and how we should define them.

This is how we understand their motives, actions, and feelings [54]. Our practice of imagining the emotions and perspectives of other people is a central feature of human social life [56]. Perspective is our ability to imagine the point of view of another. By perspective we plan our actions and predict the actions of others. It is possible that we misimagine others however. We might imagine a loved one to be in distress even though they are not. Imagined fictional personalities are not an illusion. The characters themselves have real motives and actions. However, they can be an invitation to isslusion by allowing us to connect possible characters, personalities with possible motives and actions. “We are rarely aware of the limits of our imaginative grasp of one another in everyday live, and of how often we do not manage to imagine at all” [88]. Sometimes we are unable to predict the motivations and emotions of others. This is because of an asymmetry between actions with good outcomes and others with not so good outcomes. “The asymmetry is that admiration often blocks the desire to understand, while frustration or disapporval often prompts it, so that we are more aware of the difficulties in imagining uncooperative people” [91]. While we might understand why someone commits an awful act, we cannot understand how they are able to commit the awful action. This is because we “raise the stakes for explanation of evil actions” [94]. These sorts of actions require a more thorough explanation. Yet, these do not have a special motive, but it seems that Morton attributes these to a weakness of will. I am not convinced. Distinctions between empathy and sympathy may either be: emotional resonance - feeling what another feels (e.g., Peter Goldie 2004 “On Personality,” or 2011 “Anti-empathy”) emotional appropriateness — having a suitable reaction to another person’s situation emotional identification — having an emotion that makes you take their purposes to your heart and their troubles as your concern. When we attempt to understand, by imagining, someone else’s experiences and motivations, we have to “manage a tradeoff between completeness and accuracy” [109].

And we do not want these conclusions to just depend on what is conventionally or intuitively considered good or moral. [Morton, 117]\nOur moral terms are motivated by our emotions. [Jesse Prinz, the emotional contruction of morals; Jonathan Haidt, “The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail: A social intuitiounist approach to moral judgment.” Although the way our emotions make us feel about a situation may be inappropriate, or misguided, we cannot retract the fact that our emotional response was thus. However, we can have other emotions regarding our initial emotional response which are a kind of retraction. There are some emotions which allow us multiple perspectives. For instance, we might imagine a subjective perspective, say you feel the pain your friend might have experienced when his girlfriend broke up with him, but you might also have access to a more objective emotion wherein you feel the hurt caused by your friend when he cheated on his girlfriend. “ ‘Objective’ here means, I think, not that it is some sort of physical fact, but that a person who saw the situation objectively — that is, not through one’s own eyes — would react that way” [128]. Moral emotions, given these multiple perspectives then, are imagined “complex emotions built out of two others. . . ” [131]. “The first is an attitude to a real or imagined occupant of a point of view. . . . The second is an attitude from this point of view towards an act or pattern of action” [131]. There is a great diversity and variety of moral emotions. These can correspond with imagined points of view. Further, “moral emotions, in all their discord and variety, are generated by hanging simple emotions towards people and situations along branching points of view” [139], a point of view which can vary. This might account for the problematic effects that empathy can sometimes manifest in our behaviors to strangers. Yet, having two perspectives which are oppossing [subjective and objective (in part)] to one another, will allow us to act as “impartial observers distant from the immediate situation. And in this direction we come eventually to a completely detached but rather inscrutable point of view valuing only humanity, justice, welfare” [139]. Morton suggests that this process is similar to that expressed by Lawrence Kohlberg in his “stages of moral development.” However, it is not clear whether this is something that occurs when a child matures through the stages of development from child to adult, or is it something relegated only to a kind of moral development which I think can come about later in life also. However, this varied perspective can also to not discount immediately our emotional responses to situations. For instance, we might have an emotional experience because someone mentioned a crude remark. We might initially think that we are over reacting, but as we continue to think about it and attempt to imagine scenarios wherein the remark was benign, it appears to us that there was in fact no justifcation for the remark and therefore our initial emotional response is appropriate. Moral Emotions which do not necessarily enable moral learning, or possibly prevent it: smugness, hypocracy, etc. For instance, “[w]hen you are smug, you feel approval from some respected source, directed at your general character and actions” [150]. This allows three things: An attitude to others wherein you hold some advantage over them. You become satisfied in your current state and therefore do not need change of any kind. 1 and 2 lead to complacency wherein you become comfortable in maintaining ideas of superiority over others; even if these ideas are not warranted. "},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/materials/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/motivating-apt-emotions/","title":"Motivating Apt Emotions","section":"Materials","content":"How do we come to have apt emotional expressions? On the one hand, it might be fruitless to criticize another for the lack of an emotion they are not able to produce.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t just decide to be happy, or to have some chosen belief. And if you are experiencing self-punishing remorse when regret would make more sense, it is not enough to simply tell yourself so.\nBut how true is this? What power do we have over our emotions? Some possibilities include the following:\nchange our states of mind attend selectively to evidence choose who to associate with In other words,\nwe should not conclude that we have no power over what we feel.\nHere is the main idea of this book and how this final part will develop it. We can have an enormours range of emtions, in part because our flexible imaginations allow us emotions structured around multiple points of view. So it is a real question which emotions are best for us, and when. And since emotions with multiple points of view are central to moral life, the question allows us to wonder which moral attitudes are harmful, perverse, or counterproductive. One way of making the question manageable is to consider families of moral emotions—one example consists of the much discussed cousins regret, remorse, guilt, shame, and embarrassment — and the ways in which we can slide into one of them when another would make more sense. [157] If we have a concept of a particular emotion, we are then better able to experience that emotion. From families of emotions, we can choose which ones we ought to encourage one another to feel and determine which ones are obstacles to our moral lives [158].\nDifferent emotions resemble one another. Some emotions resemble others in the way they subjectively feel whereas others resemble one another in regards to the way that motivate an agent to think or act. The important resemblances are those that relate to our moral lives, for instance shame and disapproval. Here, imagination becomes relevant because we might ask whether a particular emotion was appropriate, e.g., disapproval and anger, in a particular situation. One family of emotions includes sharme, regret, embarrassment and remorse. Embarrasment and regret are the outliers, for instance, embarrassment is more shallow than shame or remorse. We might see shame on one end and remorse on the other. For instance, shame occurs when we “we apprehend a trait as an attribute of ourselves which we take to exemplify the polar opposite of a self-relevant value’.” “In other words, the person experiencing shame feels that she is inadequate in some way that is important, as revealed by some action” [160]. Embarrassment however, is different from shame in that it includes a recognition of the ridicoulusness of your own actions. Further however, this recognition may either be followed by your own amusement or your own disgust [161]. Shame-like emotions are similar to someone staringt malevolently at you [164] while regret-like emotions result, sometimes, from events over which you had no control and which you likely had no other real options. Remorse, unlike regret, can continue to feel almost indefinitely. Moral emotions are emotions of appeal, e.g., some emotions like regret or remorse may feel like an appeal from someone affected by some past action taken by us. But each moral emotion involve varying potential perspectives of our own actions, or actions taken by others but through our own point of view. However, there are some emotions which may be hard to hard to fit between the emotion and either the target of that emotion, an attitude to a point of view inferred by that emotion etc [181—182]. There are two different emotions which can be expressed in pride. One set might be contrasted against humility while the other can be contrasted with shame. As mentioned, there is a danger that pride can result in smugness which hinders moral development rather then its consequent; self-respect. Absurdity can be contrasted with despair. Given the imagination and our moral emotions, we may imagine a situation we find ourselves in from the perspective of others, and through this realize how absurd our situation is. On the other hand, despair “recognizes the futility of hope” [165]. We might imagine a situation we find ourselves in, however, in imagining, we recognize that our situation really is hopeless. While we cannot decide to feel differently than we do at any given moment, this does not mean that we do not have control over our emotions. “I will give three reasons why having the concept of a particular moral emotion — having it in a full way by having a word for it, being able to describe cases where people experience it, and being able to imagine having it — makes it easier to enter into the emotion” [199]. “If we have a name for a pattern of behaviour, then we are more likely to notice it when it occurs, and having noticed it, we are in a better position to imagine being in a state that would lead to it, and being able to imagine it, we are nearer to being able to enter into it” [199]. This is important because as I have shown before, Morton believes that emotions correspond with various pressures. Further, pressures can be seen as a kind of motivation, so some emotion might be important to have because it will pressure a moral agent to perform certain actions in certain situations. “So with moral emotions we have a fixed frame of points of view, which needs just to have different basic emotions attached to it” [200]. “The third reason is the vividness and emotional resonance of our imagination of people” [200]. “. . . The concept of the emotion tells one what personalities to imagine, in which roles in the perspective structure of the emotion” [200]. Doing this is a way of “making moral emotions available, by giving them attention, grasping their perspective structure, and imagining occupants of their points of view” [201]. Ultimately, moral imagining is a virtue we ought to cultivate [206].

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme.

We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically. The Home Page # Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends.

Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely.

Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself # DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/","title":"Migrating from Jekyll","section":"Blog","content":" Move static content to static # Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output.

This is because Christian Hip-Hop undermines the standard narrative commonly associated with lower socio-economic communities.\nNarrative Thinking, Planning, and Agency # When making plans, we are constrained by:\ncontingent facts about ourselves\ncharacter traits\npersonality traits\nemotional dispositions\nabilities\nexternal circumstances\nevents\nother people\ntheir plans\npolicies\nintentions\npast experiences\nPast experiences are connected to counterfactual thinking and regrets\nI. Non-Actual episodes and narrative thinking # A non-actual event is one that takes place in the past and in the future, in make-believe and other fictional events, counterfactual events, non-local events (not local to the agent).\n“A narrative is a kind of representation of a sequence of events.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\n“It is more than just a bare collection, though; it reveals a certain coherence in what happened, configuring causal and other connections into a narratable episode or episodes.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is because narrative is the mental representation of a sequence of events (a sequence of thoughts, thought through, conceived (neutral timeline, neutral whether conscious or subconscious)). It provides coherence of the causal and other connections between events into a narrative episode or episodes.\nWhat we can glean from these episodes are coherence, meaningfulness, and emotional importance/import (emplotment, a psychological process which can be more or less successful) for those implicated in the narrative and those who engage with the narrative.\nIn other words, narratives give those who are implicated by them and those who engage with them, ways to consciously or subconsciously think about the events mentally represented by that narrative.\nII. Emotional Import # “Where a narrative reveals the emotional import of what is narrated, it shows (or states, or otherwise discloses) that a certain kind of response is thought to be called for or to be appropriate.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is not clear\nNarratives first seem to outline the proper emotional response to a given event.\nYet they are also distinct from emotions that are an agent’s response to a given event or sequence of events.\n“The emotional import of a narrative is thus distinct from any emotion that might be felt in response: what happened was horrifying, and I, as “external narrator,” might or might not respond with horror to my horrifying narrative of what happened.8” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThe distinction then is between emotional import and emotional response\nemotional import is integral part of the narrative\nemotional response is a response to it\nInternal and External Emotional Import # 1 First example, where they are the same # I in the narrative who feels fear\u0026mdash;I as the internal character\u0026mdash;and I respond thus in the narrative because in the narrative I find the incident to be frightening to have this particular internal emotional import\nAs an external narrator, I might also feel fear as a result of conceiving this frightening incident. Therefore this kind of response is external to the narrative.\nThe agent as character feels fear and the agent as audience also feels fear.\n2 Second example, where they differ # The agent as character may be humiliated by a more senior member at work. In the moment, all they would feel is humiliation, embarrassment, and shame.\nHowever, taking an external perspective on what happened, “I might conceive of what happened as deserving anger and resentment”\nBy thinking though these narratives, we make the emotions appropriate in response to the narrative. For instance, dramatic irony, the narrator is not aware of crucial facts about what happened until later and as such, the external emotion, the one in response to the internal emotion is different from the internal one.\n3 third example, variances # content of the thought-through narrative varies\nas does one’s grasp of what is happening in the actual world varies\nImagining a narrative scenario that explains current events for instance. You might be waiting at the train station for someone who should be there by an agreed upon time but who has not yet shown up. You imagine her getting hit by a bus, getting lost, or falling ill.\nEach imagined scenario comes complete with its own set of emotions, frustration, fear, compassion, etc.\n“When you finally actually see her arriving, your perception of her is infused with the relief that you now feel in the knowledge that your worries are baseless, and with your awareness of the past narrated possibilities of how she might not have arrived on time, and with the envisaged narrated possibilities of happiness that the future promises.11” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100) ( pdf)\nNarrative Thinking and Planning # Hypotheticals == imperatives about oughts in light of stated goals “Hypothetical imperatives are imperatives that tell you what you ought to do if you want to achieve some stated goal; as Kant puts it, they “declare a possible action to be practically necessary as a means to the attainment of something else that one wills (or that one may will).”13” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100) ( pdf)\nWhen you fall short of these goals, you experience negative emotions.\nthe negative emotions motivate counterfactual thinking, thinking back to the crucial moment that contributed to your failure to realize your goals\nRegret is an external emotion that arises in response to your decision underlying your goal failure\nEach, negative emotions, counterfactual narrative thinking, and regrets can have a feedback effect on one’s grasp of the related hypothetical imperatives, helping one to learn from one’s mistakes.\nNegative emotions then motivate counterfactual thinking.\nAn ethical turn in ethnomusicology is synonymous with a cultural one # Introduction # The authors propose challenging the existing assumptions underlying the ontology, epistemology, methodology, and axiologies important for the study of the ethics and cultural politics of music AI.\n“We propose that the time has arrived for MIR to reflect on its ethical and cultural turns (if they have been initiated at all) and take them a step further, with the goal of profoundly diversifying the discipline beyond the diversification of datasets. Such diversification, we argue, is likely to remain superficial if it is not accompanied by a simultaneous auto-critique of the discipline’s raison d’être. Indeed, this move to diversify touches on the philosophical underpinnings of what MIR is and should become as a field of research: What is music (ontology)? What are the nature and limits of knowledge concerning music (epistemology)? How do we obtain such knowledge (methodology)?

As such, music is the study of a community’s core values, what gives their community meaning, what is characteristic about their community, how they classify value and what the nature of value is for them, and the character of their value judgments [Bunnin and Yu, 2004, 65].\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/materials/","title":"Materials","section":"Docs","content":" On Games # Games and music are kinds of cultural artifacts.

In terms of the study of music information research, some questions typically include questions about the ontology of music itself, what determines genre, distribution, etc. Standard ways of answering these questions include counting the rythmic features, comparing and contrasting them with one another. One could also compare the complexity or simplicity of music, or the music\u0026rsquo;s notation. To these traditional methods of determining what the normative features for music are, Born suggests a different notion of ontology as a method of study. For these, she suggests information that the music represents. For instance, music can represent, or possess features central to a given culture, such as those that contribute to human flourishing.\n“In this light, the article asks what computational music genre recognition or recommendation would look like if, under public-cultural or non-profit imperatives, the incentives driving them aimed to optimise imaginative self- or group development, pursuing not a logic of ‘similarity’ but diversity, or took human musical flourishing as their goals.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nSome likely possibilities include the following:\nit would optimize the imaginative self development\nor group development\nwould be diverse\nand contribute to human wellbeing\n“One theme is interdisciplinarity: how MIR would gain from closer dialogues with contemporary musicology, music anthropology and sociology. The article also considers how the ‘refresh’ might address MIR’s pursuit of research oriented to technological innovation, often linked to the drive for economic growth; concerns about sustainable economies, it argues, suggest the need for other values to guide future science and engineering.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nAs such, it would be interdisciplinary with musicology, music anthropology and sociology.\nAsking, what are the\n“cultural backgrounds’ characterizing MIR as a field.1” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nWho are the members of the MIR community? To determine this, the Born proposes that there are four dimensions of diversity with questions about the community’s members being the first consideration:\n“The first is the one just referred to: who gets to be a member of ISMIR, which is to say, what is the demographic makeup of MIR as a profession?” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe second dimension is perhaps more sensitive than the author suggests. A further question is who gets to decide and what are the normative factors of such a decision?:\n“The second dimension of diversity is to do with whose music and which music, among the vast ocean of sounds in the world, gets to be the focus of MIR’s influential scientific practices.” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe third questions involves the foundational premises of the field.

They can occur in news publications when anchors and journalist establish a story about why inflation is high, but entertainment recommender systems rely on a given narrative to make suggestions to us. In previous decades, traditional radio hosts and DJs were more responsible for determining what a given population would listen to. We now know however, that there is more extensive corporate influence in the entirety of the music production process, from production to distribution, to audience listening habits. A remaining question, then, is what effects these realities portray. One potential answer involves narratives, with researchers of psychology and philosophy recognizing the ways in which narratives shape our self-identity and infuse our lives with meaning. As such, narratives can potentially constitute a key component of our own psychological development, meaning that corporate influence in the creation of mass narratives is an important topic for human wellbeing.\nIn my research, I consider the relationship between the emotional bonds among a community’s members and particular narratives central to those communities. I argue that narratives are crucial to culture, identity, and community, each of which are essential for well-being and as such, are a source of what I call moral knowledge. My research has two components. First, it explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives. Regarding this component, I am interested in all facets of public narrative, from popular music to the twenty-four-hour news cycle. The second component uses tools often used by data analysts, such as sentiment analysis (e.g., quanteda), it looks to deconstruct linguistic corpuses, and to contrast the emotional features of a given lyric corpus in response to moral kind terms in the expression of human relationships. Adopting a broadly sentimentalist moral perspective, I build upon the insights of narrative scholars like Eleonore Stump (2020), Martha Nussbaum, Mohamad Syed and Kate McLean, and other digital humanists like Marc Alfano. I propose an account where human well-being plays a vital role in questions of moral knowledge.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/materials/aesthetics-of-identity/","title":"Aesthetics of Identity","section":"Materials","content":" Introduction # In his Apt Imaginings, John Gilmore defends an account where the moral value of a work of art is grounded in the purpose and function that it was created to realize.\nI suggest that we can discover an internal relation between the artistic and moral value of a work in the relation between, broadly speaking, the moral vision of a wwork of art and the point, purpose, or function it was created to realize.\nConsidering whether some works of art have moral flaws or not, Gilmore argues that such defects are instantiated by the failure of the artist to accurately represent some content. But this says nothing about works of art that do not intend to represent moral content, but rather work towards realizing some divergent end, say entertainment, or financial capital through popularity and sales.\nThus, there are some kinds of reasons that justify an emotion felt toward a state of affairs represented in a fiction or imagining that would not justify that emotion when felt toward an analogous state of affairs in the real world.\nAs such, it is not clear how to criticize such works of art.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/materials/aesthetics/","title":"Aesthetics","section":"Materials","content":" Introduction # "},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/materials/on-narrative/","title":"On Narrative","section":"Materials","content":"Readings on Identity and Narrative.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":25,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":" Step 1.

I always thought that it was a cool concept and unlike any game I had heard of or played. I should inform the viewer however that I am not truly a gamer. What I mean by this statement, is that you, as my audience should take my claim: \u0026ldquo;unlike any game I have heard of or played\u0026rdquo; with a grain of salt. I do not have much experience. In fact, though other members of my family, namely from a previous generation (and namely exactly one) were quite early adopters of \u0026ldquo;gaming culture\u0026rdquo;, my most immediate family members were quite sceptical of anything having to do with the nature of play and make-believe. Video games, comic books, Dungeons and dragons, etc.\nRegardless of all that however, here we are. Where are we you might ask? In a simulated environment that some call a scam and others call the most ambitious project to date. Is Star Citizen a scam or a game? I personally hope that it isn\u0026rsquo;t either. What do you call a virtual environment with numerous mini games inside of it? Do games contain games? What is a game and are there normative criteria defining what counts as a game? How many nested goals should a game contain? Eve Online, another simulated environment replete with mini games could contain an answer for us. While some may be caught up in buying and selling, trading and manufacturing, others could very well get lost in the enumerable systems containing thousands of potential victims to their genocidal ideations.\nGames are a kind of artifact in this sense, at least they might be and that\u0026rsquo;s what we are here to figure out. What better place to start than in the UAE universe, more specifically, the Stanton system. Each week (Ambitious, I know. But a guy can dream can\u0026rsquo;t he?) I will upload a reading to the associated \u0026ldquo;course\u0026rdquo; website. These will be various readings on game theory, design, literary theory, cultural studies, etc, all having to do with video games. At least that is how we will apply these readings. Star Citizen will be the context.\nOn the left of this page is a list of links. Look for one that sounds interesting to you, click on it and give it a pick. You could also continue with this one which is merely some notes on readings in the philosophy of play genre. This is otherwise known, or is a grounding for the philosophy of videogames literature. Except I will spend most of the time talking about Star Citizen which is either a scam, a simulator, or the best most ambitious videogame to date. My kids hate it but they can\u0026rsquo;t look away when I play it. I consider this a win.\nMany of the material here are incomplete ramblings. Hopefully they are complete enough to transmit some kind of meaning regardless of how opaque. The intent is to be able to communicate something that motivates conversation. Oh yeah, and you can leave comments below each. Just please don\u0026rsquo;t cuss me out because my kids may be reading over my shoulder.\n“What are we doing when we play a game?” ( Nguyen, 2017, p. 1) ( pdf)\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/materials/on-narrative/sche-view-from-everywhere/","title":"Sche View From Everywhere","section":"On Narrative","content":" The View from everywhere: temporal self-experience and the Good life # “I agree with Velleman that our experience is inherently multi-perspectival but argue that there are more than two relevant perspectives and reject the claim that these perspectives have independent interests.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nThere are two ways of trying to measure well-being. On the first, the well-being of a life is measured by an accumulation of all of the moments of that life. One way to understand this is by looking, for instance, at consecutive moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life, and determining how, when the person looks back, they feel.\nOn the other, we look at individual moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life. Each moment cannot be compared to another. Momentary experiences can outweigh the total sum.\n“Expanding his metaphor of narrative, I describe the way in which these perspectives continuously influence and affect one another, and suggest that living well can be understood in terms of skillful management of the perspectives that make up this complex form of temporal self-experience.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nSchechtman argues instead, there are two perspectives of measurement.

Part 1:\nAll emotion involves imagination [1]. Imagination involves representing something to ourselves [8]. Because of imagination, we can “see” anything. Our emotions inspire us to search for actions that will address particular problems which we face. But we must make sure to distinguish between emotion and mood. e.g., emotions have objects whereas moods do not. Our emotions put pressures on our thoughts, desires, conjectures, fantasies, and perceptions. This pressure in turn is interpreted as a feeling. There are different categories of emotion understood as a four way distinction between emotion and mood. A way to understand this, is by understanding our emotions as a two-way cross-cutting distinction between passions and sentiments and another between moods and emotions [48]. mood and passion mood and sentiment emotion and passion emotion and sentiment "},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/example/","title":"Example Site","section":"Docs","content":" Introduction # Ferre hinnitibus erat accipitrem dixi Troiae tollens # Lorem markdownum, a quoque nutu est quodcumque mandasset veluti.

The morality as cooperation foundations dictionary developed by Mark Alfano is a natural language process that is intended to detect fundamental character traits in terms of moral cooperation (For moral cooperation, see Curry 2016; Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019).1 Here, I analyze a set of music lyrics by Taylor Swift using the morality as cooperation dictionary, MAC-D, developed by Alfano, Cheong, and Curry (2022).\nAccording to the ethical theory morality as cooperation (Curry 2016), humans over time have faced a number of problems necessitating the need for cooperation (Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). In response to these needs, humans and other anthropoids evolved methods for cooperation that act as solutions to these problems. As the theory continues, across all societies, we can identify traits that evolved in humans in light of these environmental needs (Shultz, Opie, and Atkinson 2011). The forms these evolved characteristics take are cooperative behaviors that resemble character traits, strategies, dispositions, behaviors, rules, norms, institutions, and technologies.\nCurry (2016) has argued there are seven:\nfamily values Kin selection explains why we love and care for our families, why parents feel a duty of care to their offspring, why we feel a special obligation to help our extended families, and why we abhor incest (Hamilton, 1964; Lieberman, Tooby, \u0026amp; Cosmides, 2003).\ngroup loyalty Mutualism explains why we coordinate our activities to pursue projects of mutual interest, why we form groups, clubs, and coalitions (there is strength and safety in numbers), why we value these groups, their members, and our membership in them, why we adopt local norms and conventions, why we feel a special obligation to come to the aid of group members, and why we value loyalty, unity and solidarity (Lewis, 1969; Royce, 1908).\nreciprocity Social exchange explains why we seek opportunities for mutually-beneficial trade, and why we feel we ought to trust others, return favours (positive reciprocity), keep promises, pay debts, fulfil contracts, be grateful for favours received, feel guilty for favours not returned, avenge injuries (negative reciprocity), punish cheats, apologise for causing injuries, and forgive those who apologise (Cosmides \u0026amp; Tooby, 2005;Trivers, 1971).\nheroism defense Conflict resolution explains why we minimise the mutual costs of disputes by engaging in ritual contests: why we proudly display cues of power and high status (‘excellences’, including bravery and generosity); and, when bested, why we express humility, and respect, defer, and submit to our superiors (Curry, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2017).\nfairness Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes over divisible resources by dividing or sharing them (often resulting in equal shares), and hence why we feel an obligation to negotiate, seek a compromise, and be fair (Messick, 1993; Skyrms, 1996).\nproperty rights Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes by recognising prior possession, hence why we feel we ought to respect others’ property and territory, and refrain from theft (Gintis, 2007).\nThe morality as cooperation view predicts that there will be the same number of types of morality as there are of cooperation (Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). They test this hypothesis using a content analysis of 600 ethnographic accounts of 60 societies chosen at random from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF). To test this hypothesis, rather than using the hand code holographic method (Otterbein 1978; Ember and Ember (2009)) used by Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa (2019), Alfano predicts that they can use natural language processing, more specifically the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count method developed by Pennebaker et al. (2015).2 LIWC combs through a text and counts the number of words belonging to a given category. For instance, LIWC has been used to count the number of first person pronouns, psychological processes such as positive and negative emotions, and discreet emotions. It relies on a given dictionary provided by the user which instructs the kinds of words to be counted.\nMoral corpora is typically used by LIWC users to count moral terms using the Moral Foundations Dictionary [MFD], for instance Hoover et all use MFD to comb tweets for 5 domains and Padfield and Buchanan (2020) use MFD to characterize the moral lean of US news organizations. However, MFD is limited in a number of ways, not having foundations for family values, reciprocity, heroism, or property rights. In addition, there are interrater reliability issues. Given these issues, Alfano et al created the Morality as Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D).\nFirst they brainstormed words aligning with the seven basic moral principles hypothesized by Curry et al. These include loving your family, being loyal to your group, returning favours, exercising courage and generosity, showing deference to superiors, being fair in the distribution of resources, and respecting property. They next used the software program WordNet, which is a large English language lexical database. When given a word or phase, Wordnet generates synsets that can be used to search related terms according to a given category: synonyms, hyponyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc.\neHRAF eHRAF is an archive of thousands of full text ethnographies (Lagace 1979). Alfano et al also relied on these ethnographic accounts to test the terms in MAC-D. To do so, they extracted 331 paragraphs from eHRAF that were labeled as ethics resulting in 1,620,644 words from 9,653, paragraphs, from 1,389 documents, covering 256 societies, 8 cultural regions, following 9 subsistence strategies. They then used the MAC dictionary to calculate the percentage of words from each paragraph that was found in one or more of the seven foundation dictionaries.\nBuilding a Dataset I have several datasets comprised of Taylor Swift song lyrics. One of these is organized by year. A good question that is available to us using this dataset, is whether there are computationally significant differences between Swift’s earlier songs and more recent ones. One kind of difference we can discern could be whether her moral commitments changed according to the MAC-D. For instance, does she make more references to family values in her earlier songs than she does her later ones.\n## [1] \u0026quot;Smokey Black Nights Lets watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights Ive seen a million things Spoke a million words Now I only want to speak to you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights Still through the haze I can make out constellations Ill make one of you and me as we sit in the sand And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights Ive played a thousand songs Sang a thousand words Now I only want to sing to you Waited on a wire Staring at the fire Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights Ive walked a thousand miles Smiled a thousand smiles Now I only smile when Im with you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights So walk with me as the sweet wind dances Ill write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Lucky You Theres a little girl in this little town With a little too much heart to go around Live forever, never say never You could do better, thats what she says Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you She sings her little song, she walks along A little pathway headed for the skies Left to travels, lives they unravel Mind over matter, thats what she says Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you Maybe shell sing you do-do-do-do Maybe shell bring you into the skies Honey shell love you, funny how some view Angels above you arent so far away Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, lucky you, lucky you \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;American Boy American boy, living life as it goes Sitting on the fence posts Living in the lie American boy, living in the real world Trying just to get the girl Trying to survive The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships Looking for the love Suddenly rise, an American beauty Suddenly he cheats, sent from above The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy American boy, raising little babies Hearing daddy maybe, Ill be like you Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn Thats grown up, American boy The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Grandview avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world will ever once destroy No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy The hope of an American boy \u0026quot;

about you long enough To forget why I needed to Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well, yeah Well maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip . This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you . The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. Ive been in the public eye since I was years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing . When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us . There will be no further explanation . There will be just reputation . \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;If Youre Anything Like Me If youre anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when youre nervous. You promise people the world, because thats what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If youre anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If youre anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If youre anything like me, Theres a justice system in your head For names youll never speak again, And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If youre anything like me Youve grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If youre anything like me, You couldnt recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If youre anything like me, Im sorry. But Darling, its going to be okay. \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;King Of My Heart Im perfectly fine, I live on my own I made up my mind, Im better off bein alone We met a few weeks ago Now you try on callin me Baby like tryin on clothes Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, Ive been waiting, waiting Ooh whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once Late in the night, the citys asleep Your love is a secret Im hoping, dreaming, dying to keep Change my priorities The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh) Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do (Where you do) And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once (Hey), Ive been waiting, waiting (Waiting) Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting) Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once Is this the end of all the endings?

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right. Whatever you do, it is not enough. Your kindness is fake. Your pain is manipulative. When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here. And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive. \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Look What You Made Me Do I dont like your little games Dont like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I dont like you I dont like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh) But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that youve been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize youre indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice (Humming) I forgot that you existed I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice I forgot that you existed How Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice So peaceful and How many nights I, how you did me How many days did I wait thinking Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong? (Humming) I forgot that you existed I thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice So peaceful and quiet I forgot that you existed \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Cornelia Street We were in the backseat Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar I rent a place on Cornelia Street I say casually in the car We were a fresh page on the desk Filling in the blanks as we go As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head Leading us home And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends Id never walk Cornelia Street again Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend Id never walk Cornelia Street again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again Windows flung right open, autumn air Jacket round my shoulders is yours We bless the rains on Cornelia Street Memorize the creaks in the floor Back when we were card sharks, playing games I thought you were leading me on I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street Before you even knew I was gone But then you called, showed your hand I turned around before I hit the tunnel Sat on the roof, you and I I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends Id never walk Cornelia Street again Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend Id never walk Cornelia Street again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again You hold my hand on the street Walk me back to that apartment Years ago, we were just inside Barefoot in the kitchen Sacred new beginnings That became my religion, listen I hope I never lose you Id never walk Cornelia Street again Oh, never again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again I dont wanna lose you (Hope it never ends) Id never walk Cornelia Street again I dont wanna lose you (Yeah) I rent a place on Cornelia Street I say casually in the car \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Lover (Piano/Vocal) Writing the song Lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano And this is what happened So it is, its basically, I dont see it as a piano. I think its that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so We could leave the Christmas lights up til January This is our place, we make the rules And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you seconds or years? Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever?

To be certain, well be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days Im on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross?

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong . An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession . A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize . Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line . My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in . A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve Now its up to you to pass them down \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dorothea Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?

Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey? A universe away And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name Im on a bench in Coney Island Wondering where did my baby go? The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go Sorry for not making you my centerfold Over and over Lost again with no surprises Disappointments, close your eyes And it gets colder and colder When the sun goes down When the sun goes down The sight that flashed before me was your face When the sun goes down But I think that I forgot to say your name Over and over Sorry for not making you my, making you my Making you my centerfold \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;happiness Honey, when Im above the trees I see this for what it is But now Im right down in it, all the years Ive given Is just shit were dividin up Showed you all of my hiding spots I was dancing when the music stopped And in the disbelief, I cant face reinvention I havent met the new me yet Therell be happiness after you But there was happiness because of you Both of these things can be true There is happiness Past the blood and bruise Past the curses and cries Beyond the terror in the nightfall Haunted by the look in my eyes That wouldve loved you for a lifetime Leave it all behind And there is happiness Tell me, when did your winning smile Begin to look like a smirk? When did all our lessons start to look like weapons Pointed at my deepest hurt?

said you never met one girl who Had as many James Taylor records as you But I do We tell stories and you dont know why Im coming off a little shy But I do But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did Ive been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again And we walked down the block to my car And I almost brought him up But you start to talk about the movies That your family watches every single Christmas And I want to talk about that And for the first time, whats past is past Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did Ive been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again On a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again \u0026#39;,

a mansion Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills But you know what they say, you cant help who you fall for And you and I fell like an early spring snow But reality crept in, you said were too different You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes [Chorus: Taylor Swift \u0026amp; Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift ] Mr. Superior Thinkin Do you have all the space that you need?

Does it make you feel sad That the love that youre lookin for Is the love that you had? Now youre out in the world, searchin for your soul Scared not to be hip, scared to get old Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me [Chorus: Taylor Swift \u0026amp; Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift ] But now that were done and its over I bet its hard to believe But it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave And, yeah , I bet you think about me [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift \u0026amp; Chris Stapleton ] I bet you think about me, yes I bet you think about me [Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift \u0026amp; Chris Stapleton ] I bet you think about me when youre out At your cool indie music concerts every week I bet you think about me in your house With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch I bet you think about me when you say Oh my god, shes insane, she wrote a song about me I bet you think about me \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Better Man (Taylors Version) I know Im probably better off on my own Than lovin a man who didnt know what he had when he had it And I see the permanent damage you did to me Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic I wish it wasnt AM, standing in the mirror Saying to myself, You know you had to do it I know the bravest thing I ever did was run Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man I know Im probably better off all alone Than needing a man who could change his mind At any given minute And it was always on your terms I waited on every careless word Hoping they might turn sweet again Like it was in the beginning But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now Talking down to me like Id always be around Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun Oh, you never thought Id run Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man Related Songs I hold onto this pride because these days its all I have And I gave to you my best And we both know you cant say that I wish you were a better man I wonder what we wouldve become If you were a better man We might still be in love If you were a better man You wouldve been the one If you were a better man Yeah, yeah Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man (Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again) We might still be in love, if you were a better man (But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man) Yeah, yeah I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man A better man We might still be in love If you were a better man You wouldve been the one If you were a better man \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Babe (Taylors Version) What about your promises, promises?

The first column to the left are the years for which a given set of songs was recorded. So for instance, according to genius.com, in 2002, Swift recorded songs like American Boy.\nAfterwards, segment refers to year year, WPS equals the mean number of words per sentence. This is a bit off as periods are not usually used to denote sentence length. In the second iteration of the analysis, I can easily use a grep function to input punctuation at the most logical places for it.\nWC refers to the total number of words in the dataset for that year. So for instance, 2002 shows a total of 776 words while 2011 shows a total of 11,486 words.\nSixltr refers to words with greater than six letters representing more formal writing. What this means is that documents with a higher percentage of words with greater than six letters are more likely to be formal documents. I do not think that you can get any less formal than music lyrics, but this might then mean that music lyrics are better a representing emotional states.\n## docname Segment WPS WC Sixltr Dic family group reciprocity heroism ##

This may become necessary when attempting to determine how to reconcile our past, current or future behaviors. A way to do so is by determining who we take ourselves to be and calculating what kinds of behaviors are a likely consequence. A popular example is that of someone who seems to remember leading soldiers into battle at Waterloo. But lets further imagine that they were born in 1980 rather than 1780. This is an extreme case however, but there is a more mundane case that can reflect the concern we associate with identity claims.\nLets imagine that for whatever reason, I seem to remember putting my keys on the kitchen counter. However, this memory may conflict with who I believe myself to be. As I have always thought of myself as the kind of self who lives an orderly and regimented life. This means that I keep an orderly home, always placing my items in the places that I designate for them. The kitchen counter is not the kind of place that I have designated for my keys and as such, I cannot reconcile this memory (putting my keys on the kitchen counter) with the kind of self that I take myself to be.\nOn a bodily criterion, identity is established if and only if the body of A is continuous with the body of B. The question being whether my body is the same body as the self that places their keys on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway. If it is, then we have established identity.\nHowever, there are various views that understand the psychological account of continuity as better expressing what we mean by identity. For instance, how do we explain phrases such as it is hard for me to reconcile the person I was with who I am. Or consider questions of legal punishment. We might think a particular inmate deserves clemency because they are no longer the person who committed a given crime. If bodily criterion is the only acceptable criterion for identity, then how do we explain rehabilitation or salvation?\nWhether or not I identify with the sort of personality that places their keys un-reflectively on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway is another way of understanding why the psychological criterion is important. Contemporary philosophical discussion on personal identity is generally concerned with reidentification and not self-knowledge. A look at one of the most prominant views in this area will follow in Section 1.\nTwo opposing views generally have been\nbodily criterion (sameness of body grounds personhood)\npsychological criterion (personality grounds personhood)\nSchechtman criticizes the psychological criterion on account that it does not provide the sort of criterion of personal identity that does not presuppose that same identity.\nI shall argue that psychological continuity does not and cannot provide the sort of criterion of personal identity which identity theorists which to provide.\nThis leads to two related claims. That:\npsychological continuity is circular and that:\nso cannot provide analysis of our concept of the persistence of a person This means that neither bodily criterion can explain identity of a person over time, but neither that the current conceptions of psychological criterion can do so as well.\nSection 1, Parfit’s view # Derek Parfit initially gives a view of identity that does not presuppose identity (reductionist). His view is a good starting point for understanding the psychological criterion and to see why it initially seemed plausible.\nFirst, an identity criterion will\nconsists in holding certain facts\nthese facts can be described without presupposing the identity of the person they belong to\nThe context\nUnderstanding non-reductive identity criterion as:\ngiving an identity criterion that does not employ facts about persons or their identities in its specification For Parfit, these are facts that establish direct psychological connections between:\n- between a memory and the experience - between an intention and an action which carried out the intention - persistence of a belief, desire, or other psychological feature “The Psychological Criterion: (1) There is psychological continuity if and only if there are overlapping chains of strong connectedness. X today is one and the same person as Y at some past time if and only if (2) X is psychologically continuous with Y, (3) this continuity has the right kind of cause, and (4) there does not exist a different person who is also” ( pdf) “psychologically continuous with Y. (5) Personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like (2) to (4) (207).” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 73) ( pdf) ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 72)\nThere is strong psychological continuity: person A, is the same person as B, where A means some individual person at a point in time t1 prior to an individual person B at a time subsequent to t1, say t2. if and only if there are strong overlapping chains of interconnectedness including:\n1. psychological continuance 2. continuity has the right kind of cause 3. there does not exist a different person who is psychologically continuous with *B* 4. and that personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like 1-3.

How do we have memories without a view about whose the memory is? Parfit:\nWe do not quasi-remember other people’s past experiences. But we might begin to do so. . . . Suppose that . . . neuro-surgeons develop ways to create in one brain a copy of a memory-trace in another brain. This might enable us to quasi-remember other people’s past experiences\nSection 3, # However,\nParfit does not explicitly define quasi desires, quasi beliefs, or quasi intentions, but he does recognize their importance within his view, and suggests that they can be specified in the same way that quasi memory is\nAlthough quasi states seems like a solution, it is not clear what these states are and how we should define them. Therefore quasi states cannot work without presupposing a superficial view of the nature of experience.\nimplies implausible view of human experience\nmemories contain personal information that quasi memories do not seem to have\nfacts about whose memory a given memory is are an integral part of its qualitative content\nwithout associations to facts about rememberer’s life and psychology, an apparent memory seems arbitrary\nor, if entire content of the apparent memory is reproduced, then memory is delusional\nfails to overcome circularity\ncannot overcome circularity\nIf quasi states include too little of the state they are said to reproduce, they do not capture what is relevant to personal identity # If quasi states include too much of the state they are said to reproduce, then unless sameness of person is assumed, they are delusional # Section 4, # A noncircular account of identity over time requires that the distinction between genuine identity and apparent continuity between psychological states is make without presupposing the identity of or the existence of the person having the states that are continuous.\nQuasi states where thought to perform this function because they can perform the task of specifying an identity criterion.\n“: \u0026ldquo;We do not quasi-remember other people\u0026rsquo;s past experiences. But we might begin to do so.. . . Suppose that . . . neuro-surgeons develop ways to create in one brain a copy of a memory-trace in another brain.” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 78) ( pdf)\nUpon implanting traces of Paul’s memories in Jane, Jane should conclude that memories of experiences she does not recognize are accurate quasi-memories of experiences had by Paul, but not delusions.\nHowever,\n“\u0026lsquo;Since Jane seems to remember seeing the lightning, she seems to remember herself seeing the lightning. Her apparent memory may tell her accurately what Paul\u0026rsquo;s experience was like, but it tells her, falsely, that it was she who had this experience\u0026rsquo;” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 79) ( pdf)\nIn other words, we cannot imagine a qualitatively like Paul’s occurring in Jane without that state being delusional.\nTwo questions of personal identity # reidentification and\nOn this view, details of a person’s memory, contain many conflicting details, however on the self-knowledge view\nPersonal identity is comprised of self-knowledge questions and not reidentification # “The person interested in self-knowledge will ask herself questions of the following sort: \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I believe?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I desire?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I intend?\u0026rsquo; Which is to ask, in a specific way, \u0026lsquo;Is this my belief?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this my desire?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this my intention?\u0026rsquo; The resources involved in answering these questions would be resources that allowed a person to assign particular psychological states to herself, and so would be at the same time resources for delimiting an individual person, and for answering questions of personal identity.” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 89) ( pdf)\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/materials/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/failing-to-imagine-emotion/","title":"Failing to Imagine Emotion","section":"Mortons Emotion and Imagination","content":" It is a common practice that we imagine other people’s emotions. This is how we understand their motives, actions, and feelings [54]. Our practice of imagining the emotions and perspectives of other people is a central feature of human social life [56]. Perspective is our ability to imagine the point of view of another. By perspective we plan our actions and predict the actions of others. It is possible that we misimagine others however. We might imagine a loved one to be in distress even though they are not. Imagined fictional personalities are not an illusion. The characters themselves have real motives and actions. However, they can be an invitation to isslusion by allowing us to connect possible characters, personalities with possible motives and actions. “We are rarely aware of the limits of our imaginative grasp of one another in everyday live, and of how often we do not manage to imagine at all” [88]. Sometimes we are unable to predict the motivations and emotions of others. This is because of an asymmetry between actions with good outcomes and others with not so good outcomes. “The asymmetry is that admiration often blocks the desire to understand, while frustration or disapporval often prompts it, so that we are more aware of the difficulties in imagining uncooperative people” [91]. While we might understand why someone commits an awful act, we cannot understand how they are able to commit the awful action. This is because we “raise the stakes for explanation of evil actions” [94]. These sorts of actions require a more thorough explanation. Yet, these do not have a special motive, but it seems that Morton attributes these to a weakness of will. I am not convinced. Distinctions between empathy and sympathy may either be: emotional resonance - feeling what another feels (e.g., Peter Goldie 2004 “On Personality,” or 2011 “Anti-empathy”) emotional appropriateness — having a suitable reaction to another person’s situation emotional identification — having an emotion that makes you take their purposes to your heart and their troubles as your concern. When we attempt to understand, by imagining, someone else’s experiences and motivations, we have to “manage a tradeoff between completeness and accuracy” [109].

And we do not want these conclusions to just depend on what is conventionally or intuitively considered good or moral. [Morton, 117]\nOur moral terms are motivated by our emotions. [Jesse Prinz, the emotional contruction of morals; Jonathan Haidt, “The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail: A social intuitiounist approach to moral judgment.” Although the way our emotions make us feel about a situation may be inappropriate, or misguided, we cannot retract the fact that our emotional response was thus. However, we can have other emotions regarding our initial emotional response which are a kind of retraction. There are some emotions which allow us multiple perspectives. For instance, we might imagine a subjective perspective, say you feel the pain your friend might have experienced when his girlfriend broke up with him, but you might also have access to a more objective emotion wherein you feel the hurt caused by your friend when he cheated on his girlfriend. “ ‘Objective’ here means, I think, not that it is some sort of physical fact, but that a person who saw the situation objectively — that is, not through one’s own eyes — would react that way” [128]. Moral emotions, given these multiple perspectives then, are imagined “complex emotions built out of two others. . . ” [131]. “The first is an attitude to a real or imagined occupant of a point of view. . . . The second is an attitude from this point of view towards an act or pattern of action” [131]. There is a great diversity and variety of moral emotions. These can correspond with imagined points of view. Further, “moral emotions, in all their discord and variety, are generated by hanging simple emotions towards people and situations along branching points of view” [139], a point of view which can vary. This might account for the problematic effects that empathy can sometimes manifest in our behaviors to strangers. Yet, having two perspectives which are oppossing [subjective and objective (in part)] to one another, will allow us to act as “impartial observers distant from the immediate situation. And in this direction we come eventually to a completely detached but rather inscrutable point of view valuing only humanity, justice, welfare” [139]. Morton suggests that this process is similar to that expressed by Lawrence Kohlberg in his “stages of moral development.” However, it is not clear whether this is something that occurs when a child matures through the stages of development from child to adult, or is it something relegated only to a kind of moral development which I think can come about later in life also. However, this varied perspective can also to not discount immediately our emotional responses to situations. For instance, we might have an emotional experience because someone mentioned a crude remark. We might initially think that we are over reacting, but as we continue to think about it and attempt to imagine scenarios wherein the remark was benign, it appears to us that there was in fact no justifcation for the remark and therefore our initial emotional response is appropriate. Moral Emotions which do not necessarily enable moral learning, or possibly prevent it: smugness, hypocracy, etc. For instance, “[w]hen you are smug, you feel approval from some respected source, directed at your general character and actions” [150]. This allows three things: An attitude to others wherein you hold some advantage over them. You become satisfied in your current state and therefore do not need change of any kind. 1 and 2 lead to complacency wherein you become comfortable in maintaining ideas of superiority over others; even if these ideas are not warranted.

On the one hand, it might be fruitless to criticize another for the lack of an emotion they are not able to produce.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t just decide to be happy, or to have some chosen belief. And if you are experiencing self-punishing remorse when regret would make more sense, it is not enough to simply tell yourself so.\nBut how true is this? What power do we have over our emotions? Some possibilities include the following:\nchange our states of mind attend selectively to evidence choose who to associate with In other words,\nwe should not conclude that we have no power over what we feel.\nHere is the main idea of this book and how this final part will develop it. We can have an enormours range of emtions, in part because our flexible imaginations allow us emotions structured around multiple points of view. So it is a real question which emotions are best for us, and when. And since emotions with multiple points of view are central to moral life, the question allows us to wonder which moral attitudes are harmful, perverse, or counterproductive. One way of making the question manageable is to consider families of moral emotions—one example consists of the much discussed cousins regret, remorse, guilt, shame, and embarrassment — and the ways in which we can slide into one of them when another would make more sense. [157] If we have a concept of a particular emotion, we are then better able to experience that emotion. From families of emotions, we can choose which ones we ought to encourage one another to feel and determine which ones are obstacles to our moral lives [158].\nDifferent emotions resemble one another. Some emotions resemble others in the way they subjectively feel whereas others resemble one another in regards to the way that motivate an agent to think or act. The important resemblances are those that relate to our moral lives, for instance shame and disapproval. Here, imagination becomes relevant because we might ask whether a particular emotion was appropriate, e.g., disapproval and anger, in a particular situation. One family of emotions includes sharme, regret, embarrassment and remorse. Embarrasment and regret are the outliers, for instance, embarrassment is more shallow than shame or remorse. We might see shame on one end and remorse on the other. For instance, shame occurs when we “we apprehend a trait as an attribute of ourselves which we take to exemplify the polar opposite of a self-relevant value’.” “In other words, the person experiencing shame feels that she is inadequate in some way that is important, as revealed by some action” [160]. Embarrassment however, is different from shame in that it includes a recognition of the ridicoulusness of your own actions. Further however, this recognition may either be followed by your own amusement or your own disgust [161]. Shame-like emotions are similar to someone staringt malevolently at you [164] while regret-like emotions result, sometimes, from events over which you had no control and which you likely had no other real options. Remorse, unlike regret, can continue to feel almost indefinitely. Moral emotions are emotions of appeal, e.g., some emotions like regret or remorse may feel like an appeal from someone affected by some past action taken by us. But each moral emotion involve varying potential perspectives of our own actions, or actions taken by others but through our own point of view. However, there are some emotions which may be hard to hard to fit between the emotion and either the target of that emotion, an attitude to a point of view inferred by that emotion etc [181—182]. There are two different emotions which can be expressed in pride. One set might be contrasted against humility while the other can be contrasted with shame. As mentioned, there is a danger that pride can result in smugness which hinders moral development rather then its consequent; self-respect. Absurdity can be contrasted with despair. Given the imagination and our moral emotions, we may imagine a situation we find ourselves in from the perspective of others, and through this realize how absurd our situation is. On the other hand, despair “recognizes the futility of hope” [165]. We might imagine a situation we find ourselves in, however, in imagining, we recognize that our situation really is hopeless. While we cannot decide to feel differently than we do at any given moment, this does not mean that we do not have control over our emotions. “I will give three reasons why having the concept of a particular moral emotion — having it in a full way by having a word for it, being able to describe cases where people experience it, and being able to imagine having it — makes it easier to enter into the emotion” [199]. “If we have a name for a pattern of behaviour, then we are more likely to notice it when it occurs, and having noticed it, we are in a better position to imagine being in a state that would lead to it, and being able to imagine it, we are nearer to being able to enter into it” [199]. This is important because as I have shown before, Morton believes that emotions correspond with various pressures. Further, pressures can be seen as a kind of motivation, so some emotion might be important to have because it will pressure a moral agent to perform certain actions in certain situations. “So with moral emotions we have a fixed frame of points of view, which needs just to have different basic emotions attached to it” [200]. “The third reason is the vividness and emotional resonance of our imagination of people” [200]. “. . . The concept of the emotion tells one what personalities to imagine, in which roles in the perspective structure of the emotion” [200]. Doing this is a way of “making moral emotions available, by giving them attention, grasping their perspective structure, and imagining occupants of their points of view” [201]. Ultimately, moral imagining is a virtue we ought to cultivate [206].

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme.

It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template.

If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme # Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static # Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle # When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage # The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page.

This is because Christian Hip-Hop undermines the standard narrative commonly associated with lower socio-economic communities.\nNarrative Thinking, Planning, and Agency # When making plans, we are constrained by:\ncontingent facts about ourselves\ncharacter traits\npersonality traits\nemotional dispositions\nabilities\nexternal circumstances\nevents\nother people\ntheir plans\npolicies\nintentions\npast experiences\nPast experiences are connected to counterfactual thinking and regrets\nI. Non-Actual episodes and narrative thinking # A non-actual event is one that takes place in the past and in the future, in make-believe and other fictional events, counterfactual events, non-local events (not local to the agent).\n“A narrative is a kind of representation of a sequence of events.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\n“It is more than just a bare collection, though; it reveals a certain coherence in what happened, configuring causal and other connections into a narratable episode or episodes.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is because narrative is the mental representation of a sequence of events (a sequence of thoughts, thought through, conceived (neutral timeline, neutral whether conscious or subconscious)). It provides coherence of the causal and other connections between events into a narrative episode or episodes.\nWhat we can glean from these episodes are coherence, meaningfulness, and emotional importance/import (emplotment, a psychological process which can be more or less successful) for those implicated in the narrative and those who engage with the narrative.\nIn other words, narratives give those who are implicated by them and those who engage with them, ways to consciously or subconsciously think about the events mentally represented by that narrative.\nII. Emotional Import # “Where a narrative reveals the emotional import of what is narrated, it shows (or states, or otherwise discloses) that a certain kind of response is thought to be called for or to be appropriate.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is not clear\nNarratives first seem to outline the proper emotional response to a given event.\nYet they are also distinct from emotions that are an agent’s response to a given event or sequence of events.\n“The emotional import of a narrative is thus distinct from any emotion that might be felt in response: what happened was horrifying, and I, as “external narrator,” might or might not respond with horror to my horrifying narrative of what happened.8” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThe distinction then is between emotional import and emotional response\nemotional import is integral part of the narrative\nemotional response is a response to it\nInternal and External Emotional Import # 1 First example, where they are the same # I in the narrative who feels fear\u0026mdash;I as the internal character\u0026mdash;and I respond thus in the narrative because in the narrative I find the incident to be frightening to have this particular internal emotional import\nAs an external narrator, I might also feel fear as a result of conceiving this frightening incident. Therefore this kind of response is external to the narrative.\nThe agent as character feels fear and the agent as audience also feels fear.\n2 Second example, where they differ # The agent as character may be humiliated by a more senior member at work. In the moment, all they would feel is humiliation, embarrassment, and shame.\nHowever, taking an external perspective on what happened, “I might conceive of what happened as deserving anger and resentment”\nBy thinking though these narratives, we make the emotions appropriate in response to the narrative. For instance, dramatic irony, the narrator is not aware of crucial facts about what happened until later and as such, the external emotion, the one in response to the internal emotion is different from the internal one.\n3 third example, variances # content of the thought-through narrative varies\nas does one’s grasp of what is happening in the actual world varies\nImagining a narrative scenario that explains current events for instance. You might be waiting at the train station for someone who should be there by an agreed upon time but who has not yet shown up. You imagine her getting hit by a bus, getting lost, or falling ill.\nEach imagined scenario comes complete with its own set of emotions, frustration, fear, compassion, etc.\n“When you finally actually see her arriving, your perception of her is infused with the relief that you now feel in the knowledge that your worries are baseless, and with your awareness of the past narrated possibilities of how she might not have arrived on time, and with the envisaged narrated possibilities of happiness that the future promises.11” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100) ( pdf)\nNarrative Thinking and Planning # Hypotheticals == imperatives about oughts in light of stated goals “Hypothetical imperatives are imperatives that tell you what you ought to do if you want to achieve some stated goal; as Kant puts it, they “declare a possible action to be practically necessary as a means to the attainment of something else that one wills (or that one may will).”13” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 100) ( pdf)\nWhen you fall short of these goals, you experience negative emotions.\nthe negative emotions motivate counterfactual thinking, thinking back to the crucial moment that contributed to your failure to realize your goals\nRegret is an external emotion that arises in response to your decision underlying your goal failure\nEach, negative emotions, counterfactual narrative thinking, and regrets can have a feedback effect on one’s grasp of the related hypothetical imperatives, helping one to learn from one’s mistakes.\nNegative emotions then motivate counterfactual thinking.\nAn ethical turn in ethnomusicology is synonymous with a cultural one # Introduction # The authors propose challenging the existing assumptions underlying the ontology, epistemology, methodology, and axiologies important for the study of the ethics and cultural politics of music AI.\n“We propose that the time has arrived for MIR to reflect on its ethical and cultural turns (if they have been initiated at all) and take them a step further, with the goal of profoundly diversifying the discipline beyond the diversification of datasets. Such diversification, we argue, is likely to remain superficial if it is not accompanied by a simultaneous auto-critique of the discipline’s raison d’être. Indeed, this move to diversify touches on the philosophical underpinnings of what MIR is and should become as a field of research: What is music (ontology)? What are the nature and limits of knowledge concerning music (epistemology)? How do we obtain such knowledge (methodology)? And what about music and our own research endeavor do we consider “good” and “valuable” (axiology)?” ( Huang et al., 2023, p. 43) ( pdf)\nwhat is the ethical and culture turns of MIR\nought to scrutinize epistemological, ontological, methodological, and axiological assumptions\nwhat are these assumptions what does it mean to diversify the discipline\nwhat is music (ontology)\nwhat are the nature and limits of knowledge in music (epistemology)\nhow do we obtain knowledge (methodology)\nwhat is good and valuable about music\nMusic generated using AI constitutes a new kind of music ecosystem.

However, being written by members of affluent countries, most current proposals risks neglecting local knowledge and value systems.\nWhile ISMIR is in a position to correct for ethical opportunities in advancing ethical principles surrounding AI technology, the individual members of the community have largely focused on the technology, ignoring the ethics.\nEthics, axiology, and technology # Axiology should be included in an ethics of AI. But here, axiology (meaning, characteristics, and classification of value, nature of evaluation, and the character of value judgments) refers to the research and the impact of the research on the stakeholders.\nSome questions:\nwho are the stakeholders\nwhat are the values of the research\nChang 2001, axiology is the philosophy of human life.

This is an example of MIR’s engaging more ethnomusicology, the study of music as culture.\nThis represents the fact that MIR is increasingly making a cultural turn. As such, music is the study of a community’s core values, what gives their community meaning, what is characteristic about their community, how they classify value and what the nature of value is for them, and the character of their value judgments [Bunnin and Yu, 2004, 65].\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/materials/music-information-research-MIR/","title":"Music Information Research MIR","section":"Games Philosophers Play","content":" Annotations # (6/29/2024, 1:39:48 PM)\nWhat is computational music genre recognition, and what would recommendation systems look like if designed by the music listening public? In terms of the study of music information research, some questions typically include questions about the ontology of music itself, what determines genre, distribution, etc. Standard ways of answering these questions include counting the rythmic features, comparing and contrasting them with one another. One could also compare the complexity or simplicity of music, or the music\u0026rsquo;s notation. To these traditional methods of determining what the normative features for music are, Born suggests a different notion of ontology as a method of study. For these, she suggests information that the music represents. For instance, music can represent, or possess features central to a given culture, such as those that contribute to human flourishing.\n“In this light, the article asks what computational music genre recognition or recommendation would look like if, under public-cultural or non-profit imperatives, the incentives driving them aimed to optimise imaginative self- or group development, pursuing not a logic of ‘similarity’ but diversity, or took human musical flourishing as their goals.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nSome likely possibilities include the following:\nit would optimize the imaginative self development\nor group development\nwould be diverse\nand contribute to human wellbeing\n“One theme is interdisciplinarity: how MIR would gain from closer dialogues with contemporary musicology, music anthropology and sociology. The article also considers how the ‘refresh’ might address MIR’s pursuit of research oriented to technological innovation, often linked to the drive for economic growth; concerns about sustainable economies, it argues, suggest the need for other values to guide future science and engineering.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nAs such, it would be interdisciplinary with musicology, music anthropology and sociology.\nAsking, what are the\n“cultural backgrounds’ characterizing MIR as a field.1” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nWho are the members of the MIR community? To determine this, the Born proposes that there are four dimensions of diversity with questions about the community’s members being the first consideration:\n“The first is the one just referred to: who gets to be a member of ISMIR, which is to say, what is the demographic makeup of MIR as a profession?” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe second dimension is perhaps more sensitive than the author suggests. A further question is who gets to decide and what are the normative factors of such a decision?:\n“The second dimension of diversity is to do with whose music and which music, among the vast ocean of sounds in the world, gets to be the focus of MIR’s influential scientific practices.” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe third questions involves the foundational premises of the field. Previously these were proposed to be questions merely of the technical\n“The third aspect of diversity is directly implicated in the previous point: it concerns the foundational epistemological and ontological premises that currently undergird MIR as a field.” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“which masters or mistresses does MIR serve – the profit-seeking imperatives of commercial music tech corporations and online music services, entangled as they are in the recorded music industries” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“And which mistresses should MIR serve in order to diversify its goals, partners and worldly effects?” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“As the STS scholar Madeleine Akrich has argued, design is a key stage in which engineers ‘script’ envisaged uses into their technologies, in this way ‘configuring’ potential user identities and preferring certain patterns of use (Akrich, 1992).” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“a key slippage was evident in a guiding assumption that the designers themselves, and their own subjective and corporeal experiences of the technologies, represented a universal user.” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“technologies resulting from these processes, emerging from gendered conditions and assumptions, embodied and entrenched existing norms –” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“o design technologies and interfaces that respond to real social diversity, then, Oudshoorn et al. argue that I-methodology, along with its universalising projections, must be reflexively acknowledged and consciously changed.” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“In suggesting that social relations and imaginaries are scripted into technological design, I am not making an essentialist point that gender identities always determine design; nor do I imply that actual users are entirely constrained to follow the scripts inscribed in the technologies.” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“The underlying point is that scientific and engineering fields like those of MIR, which are all too easy to envision as spaces isolated from wider social forces, are in fact consequential sites in which these social forces are played out, and therefore ripe for a politics of diversity” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“existing cultural categories, as they relate to social inequalities, injustices and biases, are being reproduced or amplified, and that it could be otherwise.” ( Born, 2020, p. 196) ( pdf)\n“The second dimension of diversity is the question of whose music and which music become the focus of MIR’s scientific practices and their influential applications, for example in recommendation systems.” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“to the study of traditional, folk or ethnic” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“music’ (ibid.).” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“computational ethnomusicology” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“opening up and diversifying the musical sounds and cultures with which MIR engages.” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“There is, in other words, surely a risk of teleology in beginning with existing tools derived from the analysis of Western pop and seeing if they ‘work’ for some fragmentary, decontextualised trait extracted from the total socio-musical existence of Central African music.” ( Born, 2020, p. 197) ( pdf)\n“Although an auto-critique of the elevation of Western pop music as a universal model for all music is beginning to develop within MIR, then, it seems that the profound challenges posed by ‘other’ musics have not yet been sufficiently registered and worked through (Born and Hesmondhalgh, 2000).” ( Born, 2020, p. 198) ( pdf)\n“by ideas of cultural heritage and facilitated by the ease of digital recording.

Authors have argued that the narrative implicit in country music\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic is used to construct the identity of the modern American Anglo Saxon man [@mann08; @shus99; @meis22a; @gros02; @haye10; @holl19; @hugh15; @wats20b]. Critical race theorists also ask similar questions regarding the social construction of the identities of racial minorities. Agency is a central concern on both accounts. Philosophical work on narrative and identity offers a way of understanding social influence on personal identity. In some philosophical and psychological literature, agency is rooted in one\u0026rsquo;s emotional experiences upon a retelling of their life story [@alts21; @shec90; @vell05; @kors96]. More specifically, a narrative can motivate various feelings, for instance of regret [@gold09], or pride, towards actions that one did or did not do. I consider questions of agency in regards to various relational virtues.\nOne\u0026rsquo;s emotional dispositions can effectively portray the endorsement or rejection of one\u0026rsquo;s past behavior or behaviors and subsequently, an agent\u0026rsquo;s inter-relational values. For my purposes here, there are three kinds of narratives that contribute to a narrative account of agency. They include autobiographical narratives [@mcad13; @mcad14; @pasu16]. These narratives are internalized reconstructions of events. They include an emotional evaluation of such events and taken as a whole, are central to one\u0026rsquo;s understanding of who they are. It has been argued that those which are biographical and autobiographical are important for social identities and that social identity is important for moral and relational responsibility [@mcle15; @fivu04; @fivu10]. As a case in point, we can imagine one\u0026rsquo;s sense of regret or lack thereof for a falling out between best friends, or a sense of self-blame, for the awkward way in which a dinner guest leaves their house. More importantly, we might ask how such regret motivates future behavior [Especially @gold09].\nAgency too then is an important concern in questions of personhood in this regard. We can ask what are the implications of one\u0026rsquo;s personhood when person A\u0026rsquo;s agency, rather than B\u0026rsquo;s is cited as an explanation of B\u0026rsquo;s circumstances regarding their circumstances, relational and otherwise. Of course, if we only understand identity as a progression of psychological states over time, then these differences are not as significant. Therefore such distinctions would not be as important for non-personal conceptions of identity [See @parf87; and @alts21]. But if we think that narrative and agency are important, or important sources for one\u0026rsquo;s own sense of identity, e.g. autobiographical vs biographical narrative, then emotional dispositions and their social constraints are central to human behavior. As such, narratives may be central to moral and interpersonal or inter-relational responsibility. Importantly, this is because they are central to one\u0026rsquo;s past emotional dispositions and can effectively endorse pro or anti-social behaviors.\nHowever, the sources of narrative is unclear. In regards to the relationship between narrative and identity, some are said to be biographical (personal) while others autobiographical (social) [@mcle15b]. Therefore, correspondingly, we might think that there is a missed opportunity in the existing philosophical literature on race to remark on the importance of relational agency as inferred by attributed social identities and how individuals navigate these. One area in the social construction of race where there could be more discussion, are the various characterizations of racial minorities regarding interpersonal relationship constitutions as inferred by their social identities. What does the familial structure of the typical racial minority look like according to popular culture for instance? What emotions are central to the breakup of a relationship and what emotions are central to companionship?\nI consider extracted sentiment to understand represented relational term objects in popular art [@moha21]. This will enable us to visualize emotionally valenced relational content. By analyzing the sentiment content of music lyrics, I attempt to extract those phrases that artists attach the most sentient to. These include both negatively and positively valenced cultural ascriptions of the social values among members of various populations. I ask what contributions do these make in the construction of social identities. By determining the valence, emotions, and other affectual attributions from music lyrics, I suggest that a more comprehensive project in this area will go further towards determining the portrayed broader cultural attitudes about inter-relational dispositions of minority cultures.\nWhile there is significant criticism regarding insufficient representation in media publishing, there is not similar concern for expressions of pro vs anti-social emotion expression. Some have previously attempted to explain human agency as a central aspect of personal identity by narratives both autobiographical and biographical [@mcle15b; @book22a; @brun90; @alts21; @vell05a]. This project continues that work by asking what values are suggested through an analysis of sentiment in important cultural artifacts. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, I primarily focus on popular music. Here, constructions of social identity necessarily entail relational agency more broadly. I suggest that such a study will go towards revealing the importance of broader cultural ascriptions of the relationships that exist between members of a given culture.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/materials/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/","title":"Mortons Emotion and Imagination","section":"Games Philosophers Play","content":"What is the link between emotion and imagination? This page should have its own folder like some of the other reflections. It will eventually. I am currently in the process of moving many of my notes from an older repository to this one.\nAdam Morton argues that through the use of imagination, we have the capacity to imagine another\u0026rsquo;s moral emotions by imagining their imaginings [13]\nImagining the other person\u0026rsquo;s emotion here means imagining their imagination . . .. [Morton, 206]\nIn order to avoid what Morton calls moral smugness, a vice that undermines second-personal knowledge, we must practice what he calls emotional unbundling. It is a virtue that requires that we take motives from which our own emotions are constructed and attribute them as much as it is possible to someone else\u0026rsquo;s.\nA person acts, moved by shame, approval, condemnation, or some other moral emotion. Another person tries to understand, and perhaps to anticipate the next action. But she knows that if she were acting from shame, condemnation, or approval, she would do something very different. Perhaps what he calls shame is leading him to public confession rather than wanting to hide; perhaps what he calls condemnation is leading him to teasing rather than attack. One possibility the second person must face is that his shame, or condemnation, is not hers. Perhaps they are different emotions with some family resemblance. Part of the evidence that a similar but different emotion was at work could be that the second person managed to imagine such an emotion and it fitted. But to get this evidence, she would have to be able to do the imagining.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/materials/aesthetics-of-identity/","title":"Aesthetics of Identity","section":"Games Philosophers Play","content":" Introduction # In his Apt Imaginings, John Gilmore defends an account where the moral value of a work of art is grounded in the purpose and function that it was created to realize.\nI suggest that we can discover an internal relation between the artistic and moral value of a work in the relation between, broadly speaking, the moral vision of a wwork of art and the point, purpose, or function it was created to realize.\nConsidering whether some works of art have moral flaws or not, Gilmore argues that such defects are instantiated by the failure of the artist to accurately represent some content. But this says nothing about works of art that do not intend to represent moral content, but rather work towards realizing some divergent end, say entertainment, or financial capital through popularity and sales.\nThus, there are some kinds of reasons that justify an emotion felt toward a state of affairs represented in a fiction or imagining that would not justify that emotion when felt toward an analogous state of affairs in the real world.\nAs such, it is not clear how to criticize such works of art.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/materials/moral-stories/","title":"Moral Stories","section":"Games Philosophers Play","content":" To summarize briefly, I shall describe the exploration of our problems in several fifth-century tragedies, which will insist on the irreducible role of luck in shaping human life and its value; then, Plato\u0026rsquo;s beroic attempt, in middle-period dialogues, to save the lives of human beings by making them immune to luck; finally, Aritotle\u0026rsquo;s return to many of the insights and vlaues of traggedy, as he articultates a conception of practical rational that will make human beings self-sufficient in an appropriately human way.\nWhat is the value of the poet?\nWhat about tragedy in general?\nAre its benefits practical?

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":27,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":" Step 1.

They can occur in news publications when anchors and journalist establish a story about why inflation is high, but entertainment recommender systems rely on a given narrative to make suggestions to us. In previous decades, traditional radio hosts and DJs were more responsible for determining what a given population would listen to. We now know however, that there is more extensive corporate influence in the entirety of the music production process, from production to distribution, to audience listening habits. A remaining question, then, is what effects these realities portray. One potential answer involves narratives, with researchers of psychology and philosophy recognizing the ways in which narratives shape our self-identity and infuse our lives with meaning. As such, narratives can potentially constitute a key component of our own psychological development, meaning that corporate influence in the creation of mass narratives is an important topic for human wellbeing.\nIn my research, I consider the relationship between the emotional bonds among a community’s members and particular narratives central to those communities. I argue that narratives are crucial to culture, identity, and community, each of which are essential for well-being and as such, are a source of what I call moral knowledge. My research has two components. First, it explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives. Regarding this component, I am interested in all facets of public narrative, from popular music to the twenty-four-hour news cycle. The second component uses tools often used by data analysts, such as sentiment analysis (e.g., quanteda), it looks to deconstruct linguistic corpuses, and to contrast the emotional features of a given lyric corpus in response to moral kind terms in the expression of human relationships. Adopting a broadly sentimentalist moral perspective, I build upon the insights of narrative scholars like Eleonore Stump (2020), Martha Nussbaum, Mohamad Syed and Kate McLean, and other digital humanists like Marc Alfano. I propose an account where human well-being plays a vital role in questions of moral knowledge.\n"}]

I always thought that it was a cool concept and unlike any game I had heard of or played. I should inform the viewer however that I am not truly a gamer. What I mean by this statement, is that you, as my audience should take my claim: \u0026ldquo;unlike any game I have heard of or played\u0026rdquo; with a grain of salt. I do not have much experience. In fact, though other members of my family, namely from a previous generation (and namely exactly one) were quite early adopters of \u0026ldquo;gaming culture\u0026rdquo;, my most immediate family members were quite sceptical of anything having to do with the nature of play and make-believe. Video games, comic books, Dungeons and dragons, etc.\nRegardless of all that however, here we are. Where are we you might ask? In a simulated environment that some call a scam and others call the most ambitious project to date. Is Star Citizen a scam or a game? I personally hope that it isn\u0026rsquo;t either. What do you call a virtual environment with numerous mini games inside of it? Do games contain games? What is a game and are there normative criteria defining what counts as a game? How many nested goals should a game contain? Eve Online, another simulated environment replete with mini games could contain an answer for us. While some may be caught up in buying and selling, trading and manufacturing, others could very well get lost in the enumerable systems containing thousands of potential victims to their genocidal ideations.\nGames are a kind of artifact in this sense, at least they might be and that\u0026rsquo;s what we are here to figure out. What better place to start than in the UAE universe, more specifically, the Stanton system. Each week (Ambitious, I know. But a guy can dream can\u0026rsquo;t he?) I will upload a reading to the associated \u0026ldquo;course\u0026rdquo; website. These will be various readings on game theory, design, literary theory, cultural studies, etc, all having to do with video games. At least that is how we will apply these readings. Star Citizen will be the context.\nOn the left of this page is a list of links. Look for one that sounds interesting to you, click on it and give it a pick. You could also continue with this one which is merely some notes on readings in the philosophy of play genre. This is otherwise known, or is a grounding for the philosophy of videogames literature. Except I will spend most of the time talking about Star Citizen which is either a scam, a simulator, or the best most ambitious videogame to date. My kids hate it but they can\u0026rsquo;t look away when I play it. I consider this a win.\nMany of the material here are incomplete ramblings. Hopefully they are complete enough to transmit some kind of meaning regardless of how opaque. The intent is to be able to communicate something that motivates conversation. Oh yeah, and you can leave comments below each. Just please don\u0026rsquo;t cuss me out because my kids may be reading over my shoulder.\n“What are we doing when we play a game?” ( Nguyen, 2017, p. 1) ( pdf)\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/philosophers/schectman-narrative/sche-view-from-everywhere/","title":"Sche View From Everywhere","section":"Schectman, On Narrative","content":" The View from everywhere: temporal self-experience and the Good life # “I agree with Velleman that our experience is inherently multi-perspectival but argue that there are more than two relevant perspectives and reject the claim that these perspectives have independent interests.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nThere are two ways of trying to measure well-being. On the first, the well-being of a life is measured by an accumulation of all of the moments of that life. One way to understand this is by looking, for instance, at consecutive moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life, and determining how, when the person looks back, they feel.\nOn the other, we look at individual moments of a person\u0026rsquo;s life. Each moment cannot be compared to another. Momentary experiences can outweigh the total sum.\n“Expanding his metaphor of narrative, I describe the way in which these perspectives continuously influence and affect one another, and suggest that living well can be understood in terms of skillful management of the perspectives that make up this complex form of temporal self-experience.” ( Schechtman, 2022, p. 1) ( pdf)\nSchechtman argues instead, there are two perspectives of measurement.

The morality as cooperation foundations dictionary developed by Mark Alfano is a natural language process that is intended to detect fundamental character traits in terms of moral cooperation (For moral cooperation, see Curry 2016; Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019).1 Here, I analyze a set of music lyrics by Taylor Swift using the morality as cooperation dictionary, MAC-D, developed by Alfano, Cheong, and Curry (2022).\nAccording to the ethical theory morality as cooperation (Curry 2016), humans over time have faced a number of problems necessitating the need for cooperation (Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). In response to these needs, humans and other anthropoids evolved methods for cooperation that act as solutions to these problems. As the theory continues, across all societies, we can identify traits that evolved in humans in light of these environmental needs (Shultz, Opie, and Atkinson 2011). The forms these evolved characteristics take are cooperative behaviors that resemble character traits, strategies, dispositions, behaviors, rules, norms, institutions, and technologies.\nfamily values Kin selection explains why we love and care for our families, why parents feel a duty of care to their offspring, why we feel a special obligation to help our extended families, and why we abhor incest (Hamilton, 1964; Lieberman, Tooby, \u0026amp; Cosmides, 2003).\ngroup loyalty Mutualism explains why we coordinate our activities to pursue projects of mutual interest, why we form groups, clubs, and coalitions (there is strength and safety in numbers), why we value these groups, their members, and our membership in them, why we adopt local norms and conventions, why we feel a special obligation to come to the aid of group members, and why we value loyalty, unity and solidarity (Lewis, 1969; Royce, 1908).\nreciprocity Social exchange explains why we seek opportunities for mutually-beneficial trade, and why we feel we ought to trust others, return favours (positive reciprocity), keep promises, pay debts, fulfil contracts, be grateful for favours received, feel guilty for favours not returned, avenge injuries (negative reciprocity), punish cheats, apologise for causing injuries, and forgive those who apologise (Cosmides \u0026amp; Tooby, 2005;Trivers, 1971).\nheroism defense Conflict resolution explains why we minimise the mutual costs of disputes by engaging in ritual contests: why we proudly display cues of power and high status (‘excellences’, including bravery and generosity); and, when bested, why we express humility, and respect, defer, and submit to our superiors (Curry, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2017).\nfairness Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes over divisible resources by dividing or sharing them (often resulting in equal shares), and hence why we feel an obligation to negotiate, seek a compromise, and be fair (Messick, 1993; Skyrms, 1996).\nproperty rights Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes by recognising prior possession, hence why we feel we ought to respect others’ property and territory, and refrain from theft (Gintis, 2007).\nThe morality as cooperation view predicts that there will be the same number of types of morality as there are of cooperation (Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). They test this hypothesis using a content analysis of 600 ethnographic accounts of 60 societies chosen at random from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF). To test this hypothesis, rather than using the hand code holographic method (Otterbein 1978; Ember and Ember (2009)) used by Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa (2019), Alfano predicts that they can use natural language processing, more specifically the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count method developed by Pennebaker et al. (2015).2 LIWC combs through a text and counts the number of words belonging to a given category. For instance, LIWC has been used to count the number of first person pronouns, psychological processes such as positive and negative emotions, and discreet emotions. It relies on a given dictionary provided by the user which instructs the kinds of words to be counted.\nMoral corpora is typically used by LIWC users to count moral terms using the Moral Foundations Dictionary [MFD], for instance Hoover et all use MFD to comb tweets for 5 domains and Padfield and Buchanan (2020) use MFD to characterize the moral lean of US news organizations. However, MFD is limited in a number of ways, not having foundations for family values, reciprocity, heroism, or property rights. In addition, there are interrater reliability issues. Given these issues, Alfano et al created the Morality as Cooperation Dictionary (MAC-D).\nFirst they brainstormed words aligning with the seven basic moral principles hypothesized by Curry et al. These include loving your family, being loyal to your group, returning favours, exercising courage and generosity, showing deference to superiors, being fair in the distribution of resources, and respecting property. They next used the software program WordNet, which is a large English language lexical database. When given a word or phase, Wordnet generates synsets that can be used to search related terms according to a given category: synonyms, hyponyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc.\neHRAF eHRAF is an archive of thousands of full text ethnographies (Lagace 1979). Alfano et al also relied on these ethnographic accounts to test the terms in MAC-D. To do so, they extracted 331 paragraphs from eHRAF that were labeled as ethics resulting in 1,620,644 words from 9,653, paragraphs, from 1,389 documents, covering 256 societies, 8 cultural regions, following 9 subsistence strategies. They then used the MAC dictionary to calculate the percentage of words from each paragraph that was found in one or more of the seven foundation dictionaries.\nBuilding a Dataset I have several datasets comprised of Taylor Swift song lyrics. One of these is organized by year. A good question that is available to us using this dataset, is whether there are computationally significant differences between Swift’s earlier songs and more recent ones. One kind of difference we can discern could be whether her moral commitments changed according to the MAC-D. For instance, does she make more references to family values in her earlier songs than she does her later ones.\n## year ## 1 2002 ## 2 2003 ## 3 2004 ## 4 2006 ## 5 2007 ## 6 2008 ## lyrics ## 1 Smokey Black Nights Lyrics Lets watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights Ive seen a million things Spoke a million words Now I only want to speak to you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights Still through the haze I can make out constellations Ill make one of you and me as we sit in the sand And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights Ive played a thousand songs Sang a thousand words Now I only want to sing to you Waited on a wire Staring at the fire Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights Ive walked a thousand miles Smiled a thousand smiles Now I only smile when Im with you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights So walk with me as the sweet wind dances Ill write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights 1 Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Lucky You Lyrics Theres a little girl in this little town With a little too much heart to go around Live forever, never say never You could do better, thats what she says Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you She sings her little song, she walks along A little pathway headed for the skies Left to travels, lives they unravel Mind over matter, thats what she says Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you Maybe shell sing you do-do-do-do Maybe shell bring you into the skies Honey shell love you, funny how some view Angels above you arent so far away Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, lucky you, lucky you Embed\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;American Boy Lyrics American boy, living life as it goes Sitting on the fence posts Living in the lie American boy, living in the real world Trying just to get the girl Trying to survive The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships Looking for the love Suddenly rise, an American beauty Suddenly he cheats, sent from above The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy American boy, raising little babies Hearing daddy maybe, Ill be like you Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn Thats grown up, American boy The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Grandview avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world will ever once destroy No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy The hope of an American boy 1 Embed ##

walks her walk Up and down the staircase Make up fresh on her face She thinks about it as she talks her talk School dance, first chance Always been a dreamer Theres one guy, shes shy Sees him through

soon She thinks about it when she sees headlights Looking out the window Shes got her diary to show That shes been waiting for this all her life First date, cant wait Looking in the mirror Heart all wrapped up Wait until he sees her Hes looking right at her She thinks about it Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt Shoes, purse, hair tied back And you should see her Shes got her magic Floating through the air The years went by The mirror saw her cry She got up again She got up again The wind blew by The small town lights She got up again Move out, find out Where the world can take her

jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me September saw a month of tears And thankin God that you werent here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet And lookin back on all of that, its nice to believe When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me And Im back for the first time since then Im standin on your street And theres a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that youll read is: When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song Someday youll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my

The first column to the left are the years for which a given set of songs was recorded. So for instance, according to genius.com, in 2002, Swift recorded songs like American Boy.\nAfterwards, segment refers to year year, WPS equals the mean number of words per sentence. This is a bit off as periods are not usually used to denote sentence length. In the second iteration of the analysis, I can easily use a grep function to input punctuation at the most logical places for it.\nWC refers to the total number of words in the dataset for that year. So for instance, 2002 shows a total of 776 words while 2011 shows a total of 11,486 words.\nSixltr refers to words with greater than six letters representing more formal writing. What this means is that documents with a higher percentage of words with greater than six letters are more likely to be formal documents. I do not think that you can get any less formal than music lyrics, but this might then mean that music lyrics are better a representing emotional states.\n## docname Segment WPS WC Sixltr Dic family group reciprocity heroism ##

This may become necessary when attempting to determine how to reconcile our past, current or future behaviors. A way to do so is by determining who we take ourselves to be and calculating what kinds of behaviors are a likely consequence. A popular example is that of someone who seems to remember leading soldiers into battle at Waterloo. But lets further imagine that they were born in 1980 rather than 1780. This is an extreme case however, but there is a more mundane case that can reflect the concern we associate with identity claims.\nLets imagine that for whatever reason, I seem to remember putting my keys on the kitchen counter. However, this memory may conflict with who I believe myself to be. As I have always thought of myself as the kind of self who lives an orderly and regimented life. This means that I keep an orderly home, always placing my items in the places that I designate for them. The kitchen counter is not the kind of place that I have designated for my keys and as such, I cannot reconcile this memory (putting my keys on the kitchen counter) with the kind of self that I take myself to be.\nOn a bodily criterion, identity is established if and only if the body of A is continuous with the body of B. The question being whether my body is the same body as the self that places their keys on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway. If it is, then we have established identity.\nHowever, there are various views that understand the psychological account of continuity as better expressing what we mean by identity. For instance, how do we explain phrases such as it is hard for me to reconcile the person I was with who I am. Or consider questions of legal punishment. We might think a particular inmate deserves clemency because they are no longer the person who committed a given crime. If bodily criterion is the only acceptable criterion for identity, then how do we explain rehabilitation or salvation?\nWhether or not I identify with the sort of personality that places their keys un-reflectively on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway is another way of understanding why the psychological criterion is important. Contemporary philosophical discussion on personal identity is generally concerned with reidentification and not self-knowledge. A look at one of the most prominant views in this area will follow in Section 1.\nTwo opposing views generally have been\nbodily criterion (sameness of body grounds personhood)\npsychological criterion (personality grounds personhood)\nSchechtman criticizes the psychological criterion on account that it does not provide the sort of criterion of personal identity that does not presuppose that same identity.\nI shall argue that psychological continuity does not and cannot provide the sort of criterion of personal identity which identity theorists which to provide.\nThis leads to two related claims. That:\npsychological continuity is circular and that:\nso cannot provide analysis of our concept of the persistence of a person This means that neither bodily criterion can explain identity of a person over time, but neither that the current conceptions of psychological criterion can do so as well.\nSection 1, Parfit’s view # Derek Parfit initially gives a view of identity that does not presuppose identity (reductionist). His view is a good starting point for understanding the psychological criterion and to see why it initially seemed plausible.\nFirst, an identity criterion will\nconsists in holding certain facts\nthese facts can be described without presupposing the identity of the person they belong to\nThe context\nUnderstanding non-reductive identity criterion as:\ngiving an identity criterion that does not employ facts about persons or their identities in its specification For Parfit, these are facts that establish direct psychological connections between:\n- between a memory and the experience - between an intention and an action which carried out the intention - persistence of a belief, desire, or other psychological feature “The Psychological Criterion: (1) There is psychological continuity if and only if there are overlapping chains of strong connectedness. X today is one and the same person as Y at some past time if and only if (2) X is psychologically continuous with Y, (3) this continuity has the right kind of cause, and (4) there does not exist a different person who is also” ( pdf) “psychologically continuous with Y. (5) Personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like (2) to (4) (207).” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 73) ( pdf) ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 72)\nThere is strong psychological continuity: person A, is the same person as B, where A means some individual person at a point in time t1 prior to an individual person B at a time subsequent to t1, say t2. if and only if there are strong overlapping chains of interconnectedness including:\n1. psychological continuance 2. continuity has the right kind of cause 3. there does not exist a different person who is psychologically continuous with *B* 4. and that personal identity over time just consists in the holding of facts like 1-3. Section 2, The circularity objection and standard response # But, “we can seem to remember experiences which are not ours . . . such seeming memories are no basis for claims of personal identity”\n(2) x is psychologically continuous with y\npresupposition? (3) this continuity has the right kind of cause\nwhat would be the right kind of cause for a memory?\nmemory presupposes “persistence of a single individual”\ngenuine vs delusional memory is defined by identity vs nonidentity intention\naction counts as intended if same person so defined by identity (4) there does not exist a different person who is also “psychologically continuous with y.\nfalse memories would have two different persons that are psychologically continuous with y.\nonly one person if the other has lost their memory of an event\nParfit’s response to this objection is grounded in undefined quasi states.\nquasi memories\nquasi intentions\nThe circularity objection # We can only remember our own experiences\n(1) The fact that we can only remember our own experiences is not [cannot be] the reason why (genuine) memory connectedness is a plausible criterion of personal identity\nYet quasi-memory connectedness will do just as well as genuine memory in specifying an identity criterion\nTherefore, whatever is the reason why genuine memory specifies an identity criterion, is also present in quasi memory\nBut (1 -2), The fact that we can only remember our own experiences [cannot be] the reason why quasi memory connectedness is a plausible criterion of personal identity\nThe nondelusionality of a memory\nits relevance to the constitution of personal identity\nAccording to the circularity objection, memory presupposes personal identity. # However, the examples that are used to underlie this claim, rely on the need to use personal identity to distinguish between delusional and nondelusional memories.\nHow do we prove that genuine memory is nondelusional without presupposing personal identity?\nOne problem is that in answering the above question\ndoes not show us that quasi memories capture what is relevant to personal identity in genuine memory\ncannot be captured without presupposing personal identity\nThe nondelusionality of quasi memory # memory == apparent memory and to correctly take it as being one’s own experience\ndelusion == apparent memory and to incorrectly take it as being one’s own experience\nquasi memory == apparent memory (properly caused) and to hold no view about whose memory it is, so does not reference sameness of person\nBut what is this grounded in? How do we have memories without a view about whose the memory is? Parfit:\nWe do not quasi-remember other people’s past experiences. But we might begin to do so. . . . Suppose that . . . neuro-surgeons develop ways to create in one brain a copy of a memory-trace in another brain. This might enable us to quasi-remember other people’s past experiences\nSection 3, # However,\nParfit does not explicitly define quasi desires, quasi beliefs, or quasi intentions, but he does recognize their importance within his view, and suggests that they can be specified in the same way that quasi memory is\nAlthough quasi states seems like a solution, it is not clear what these states are and how we should define them. Therefore quasi states cannot work without presupposing a superficial view of the nature of experience.\nimplies implausible view of human experience\nmemories contain personal information that quasi memories do not seem to have\nfacts about whose memory a given memory is are an integral part of its qualitative content\nwithout associations to facts about rememberer’s life and psychology, an apparent memory seems arbitrary\nor, if entire content of the apparent memory is reproduced, then memory is delusional\nfails to overcome circularity\ncannot overcome circularity\nIf quasi states include too little of the state they are said to reproduce, they do not capture what is relevant to personal identity # If quasi states include too much of the state they are said to reproduce, then unless sameness of person is assumed, they are delusional # Section 4, # A noncircular account of identity over time requires that the distinction between genuine identity and apparent continuity between psychological states is make without presupposing the identity of or the existence of the person having the states that are continuous.\nQuasi states where thought to perform this function because they can perform the task of specifying an identity criterion.\n“: \u0026ldquo;We do not quasi-remember other people\u0026rsquo;s past experiences. But we might begin to do so.. . . Suppose that . . . neuro-surgeons develop ways to create in one brain a copy of a memory-trace in another brain.” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 78) ( pdf)\nUpon implanting traces of Paul’s memories in Jane, Jane should conclude that memories of experiences she does not recognize are accurate quasi-memories of experiences had by Paul, but not delusions.\nHowever,\n“\u0026lsquo;Since Jane seems to remember seeing the lightning, she seems to remember herself seeing the lightning. Her apparent memory may tell her accurately what Paul\u0026rsquo;s experience was like, but it tells her, falsely, that it was she who had this experience\u0026rsquo;” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 79) ( pdf)\nIn other words, we cannot imagine a qualitatively like Paul’s occurring in Jane without that state being delusional.\nTwo questions of personal identity # reidentification and\nOn this view, details of a person’s memory, contain many conflicting details, however on the self-knowledge view\nPersonal identity is comprised of self-knowledge questions and not reidentification # “The person interested in self-knowledge will ask herself questions of the following sort: \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I believe?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I desire?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this really what I intend?\u0026rsquo; Which is to ask, in a specific way, \u0026lsquo;Is this my belief?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this my desire?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Is this my intention?\u0026rsquo; The resources involved in answering these questions would be resources that allowed a person to assign particular psychological states to herself, and so would be at the same time resources for delimiting an individual person, and for answering questions of personal identity.” ( Schechtman, 1990, p. 89) ( pdf)\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/books/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/failing-to-imagine-emotion/","title":"Failing to Imagine Emotion","section":"Morton's Emotion and Imagination","content":" It is a common practice that we imagine other people’s emotions. This is how we understand their motives, actions, and feelings [54]. Our practice of imagining the emotions and perspectives of other people is a central feature of human social life [56]. Perspective is our ability to imagine the point of view of another. By perspective we plan our actions and predict the actions of others. It is possible that we misimagine others however. We might imagine a loved one to be in distress even though they are not. Imagined fictional personalities are not an illusion. The characters themselves have real motives and actions. However, they can be an invitation to isslusion by allowing us to connect possible characters, personalities with possible motives and actions. “We are rarely aware of the limits of our imaginative grasp of one another in everyday live, and of how often we do not manage to imagine at all” [88]. Sometimes we are unable to predict the motivations and emotions of others. This is because of an asymmetry between actions with good outcomes and others with not so good outcomes. “The asymmetry is that admiration often blocks the desire to understand, while frustration or disapporval often prompts it, so that we are more aware of the difficulties in imagining uncooperative people” [91]. While we might understand why someone commits an awful act, we cannot understand how they are able to commit the awful action. This is because we “raise the stakes for explanation of evil actions” [94]. These sorts of actions require a more thorough explanation. Yet, these do not have a special motive, but it seems that Morton attributes these to a weakness of will. I am not convinced. Distinctions between empathy and sympathy may either be: emotional resonance - feeling what another feels (e.g., Peter Goldie 2004 “On Personality,” or 2011 “Anti-empathy”) emotional appropriateness — having a suitable reaction to another person’s situation emotional identification — having an emotion that makes you take their purposes to your heart and their troubles as your concern. When we attempt to understand, by imagining, someone else’s experiences and motivations, we have to “manage a tradeoff between completeness and accuracy” [109].

This is how we understand their motives, actions, and feelings [54]. Our practice of imagining the emotions and perspectives of other people is a central feature of human social life [56]. Perspective is our ability to imagine the point of view of another. By perspective we plan our actions and predict the actions of others. It is possible that we misimagine others however. We might imagine a loved one to be in distress even though they are not. Imagined fictional personalities are not an illusion. The characters themselves have real motives and actions.

However, we can have other emotions regarding our initial emotional response which are a kind of retraction. There are some emotions which allow us multiple perspectives. For instance, we might imagine a subjective perspective, say you feel the pain your friend might have experienced when his girlfriend broke up with him, but you might also have access to a more objective emotion wherein you feel the hurt caused by your friend when he cheated on his girlfriend. “ ‘Objective’ here means, I think, not that it is some sort of physical fact, but that a person who saw the situation objectively — that is, not through one’s own eyes — would react that way” [128]. Moral emotions, given these multiple perspectives then, are imagined “complex emotions built out of two others. . . ” [131]. “The first is an attitude to a real or imagined occupant of a point of view. . . . The second is an attitude from this point of view towards an act or pattern of action” [131]. There is a great diversity and variety of moral emotions. These can correspond with imagined points of view. Further, “moral emotions, in all their discord and variety, are generated by hanging simple emotions towards people and situations along branching points of view” [139], a point of view which can vary. This might account for the problematic effects that empathy can sometimes manifest in our behaviors to strangers. Yet, having two perspectives which are oppossing [subjective and objective (in part)] to one another, will allow us to act as “impartial observers distant from the immediate situation.

Morton suggests that this process is similar to that expressed by Lawrence Kohlberg in his “stages of moral development.” However, it is not clear whether this is something that occurs when a child matures through the stages of development from child to adult, or is it something relegated only to a kind of moral development which I think can come about later in life also. However, this varied perspective can also to not discount immediately our emotional responses to situations. For instance, we might have an emotional experience because someone mentioned a crude remark. We might initially think that we are over reacting, but as we continue to think about it and attempt to imagine scenarios wherein the remark was benign, it appears to us that there was in fact no justifcation for the remark and therefore our initial emotional response is appropriate. Moral Emotions which do not necessarily enable moral learning, or possibly prevent it: smugness, hypocracy, etc. For instance, “[w]hen you are smug, you feel approval from some respected source, directed at your general character and actions” [150]. This allows three things: An attitude to others wherein you hold some advantage over them. You become satisfied in your current state and therefore do not need change of any kind. 1 and 2 lead to complacency wherein you become comfortable in maintaining ideas of superiority over others; even if these ideas are not warranted.

We can have an enormours range of emtions, in part because our flexible imaginations allow us emotions structured around multiple points of view. So it is a real question which emotions are best for us, and when. And since emotions with multiple points of view are central to moral life, the question allows us to wonder which moral attitudes are harmful, perverse, or counterproductive. One way of making the question manageable is to consider families of moral emotions—one example consists of the much discussed cousins regret, remorse, guilt, shame, and embarrassment — and the ways in which we can slide into one of them when another would make more sense. [157] If we have a concept of a particular emotion, we are then better able to experience that emotion. From families of emotions, we can choose which ones we ought to encourage one another to feel and determine which ones are obstacles to our moral lives [158].\nDifferent emotions resemble one another. Some emotions resemble others in the way they subjectively feel whereas others resemble one another in regards to the way that motivate an agent to think or act. The important resemblances are those that relate to our moral lives, for instance shame and disapproval. Here, imagination becomes relevant because we might ask whether a particular emotion was appropriate, e.g., disapproval and anger, in a particular situation. One family of emotions includes sharme, regret, embarrassment and remorse. Embarrasment and regret are the outliers, for instance, embarrassment is more shallow than shame or remorse. We might see shame on one end and remorse on the other. For instance, shame occurs when we “we apprehend a trait as an attribute of ourselves which we take to exemplify the polar opposite of a self-relevant value’.” “In other words, the person experiencing shame feels that she is inadequate in some way that is important, as revealed by some action” [160]. Embarrassment however, is different from shame in that it includes a recognition of the ridicoulusness of your own actions. Further however, this recognition may either be followed by your own amusement or your own disgust [161]. Shame-like emotions are similar to someone staringt malevolently at you [164] while regret-like emotions result, sometimes, from events over which you had no control and which you likely had no other real options. Remorse, unlike regret, can continue to feel almost indefinitely. Moral emotions are emotions of appeal, e.g., some emotions like regret or remorse may feel like an appeal from someone affected by some past action taken by us. But each moral emotion involve varying potential perspectives of our own actions, or actions taken by others but through our own point of view. However, there are some emotions which may be hard to hard to fit between the emotion and either the target of that emotion, an attitude to a point of view inferred by that emotion etc [181—182]. There are two different emotions which can be expressed in pride. One set might be contrasted against humility while the other can be contrasted with shame. As mentioned, there is a danger that pride can result in smugness which hinders moral development rather then its consequent; self-respect. Absurdity can be contrasted with despair. Given the imagination and our moral emotions, we may imagine a situation we find ourselves in from the perspective of others, and through this realize how absurd our situation is. On the other hand, despair “recognizes the futility of hope” [165]. We might imagine a situation we find ourselves in, however, in imagining, we recognize that our situation really is hopeless. While we cannot decide to feel differently than we do at any given moment, this does not mean that we do not have control over our emotions. “I will give three reasons why having the concept of a particular moral emotion — having it in a full way by having a word for it, being able to describe cases where people experience it, and being able to imagine having it — makes it easier to enter into the emotion” [199]. “If we have a name for a pattern of behaviour, then we are more likely to notice it when it occurs, and having noticed it, we are in a better position to imagine being in a state that would lead to it, and being able to imagine it, we are nearer to being able to enter into it” [199]. This is important because as I have shown before, Morton believes that emotions correspond with various pressures. Further, pressures can be seen as a kind of motivation, so some emotion might be important to have because it will pressure a moral agent to perform certain actions in certain situations. “So with moral emotions we have a fixed frame of points of view, which needs just to have different basic emotions attached to it” [200]. “The third reason is the vividness and emotional resonance of our imagination of people” [200]. “. . . The concept of the emotion tells one what personalities to imagine, in which roles in the perspective structure of the emotion” [200]. Doing this is a way of “making moral emotions available, by giving them attention, grasping their perspective structure, and imagining occupants of their points of view” [201]. Ultimately, moral imagining is a virtue we ought to cultivate [206].

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions # There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins # Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page # The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File # When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent # Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter # The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown # Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files # Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template # A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template # A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template # A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site # Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site.

We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths.

In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton # Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory # When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this.

There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage # The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts # We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File # $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Non-Actual episodes and narrative thinking # A non-actual event is one that takes place in the past and in the future, in make-believe and other fictional events, counterfactual events, non-local events (not local to the agent).\n“A narrative is a kind of representation of a sequence of events.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\n“It is more than just a bare collection, though; it reveals a certain coherence in what happened, configuring causal and other connections into a narratable episode or episodes.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is because narrative is the mental representation of a sequence of events (a sequence of thoughts, thought through, conceived (neutral timeline, neutral whether conscious or subconscious)). It provides coherence of the causal and other connections between events into a narrative episode or episodes.\nWhat we can glean from these episodes are coherence, meaningfulness, and emotional importance/import (emplotment, a psychological process which can be more or less successful) for those implicated in the narrative and those who engage with the narrative.\nIn other words, narratives give those who are implicated by them and those who engage with them, ways to consciously or subconsciously think about the events mentally represented by that narrative.\nII. Emotional Import # “Where a narrative reveals the emotional import of what is narrated, it shows (or states, or otherwise discloses) that a certain kind of response is thought to be called for or to be appropriate.” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThis is not clear\nNarratives first seem to outline the proper emotional response to a given event.\nYet they are also distinct from emotions that are an agent’s response to a given event or sequence of events.\n“The emotional import of a narrative is thus distinct from any emotion that might be felt in response: what happened was horrifying, and I, as “external narrator,” might or might not respond with horror to my horrifying narrative of what happened.8” ( GOLDIE, 2009, p. 98) ( pdf)\nThe distinction then is between emotional import and emotional response\nemotional import is integral part of the narrative\nemotional response is a response to it\nInternal and External Emotional Import # 1 First example, where they are the same # I in the narrative who feels fear\u0026mdash;I as the internal character\u0026mdash;and I respond thus in the narrative because in the narrative I find the incident to be frightening to have this particular internal emotional import\nAs an external narrator, I might also feel fear as a result of conceiving this frightening incident. Therefore this kind of response is external to the narrative.\nThe agent as character feels fear and the agent as audience also feels fear.\n2 Second example, where they differ # The agent as character may be humiliated by a more senior member at work. In the moment, all they would feel is humiliation, embarrassment, and shame.\nHowever, taking an external perspective on what happened, “I might conceive of what happened as deserving anger and resentment”\nBy thinking though these narratives, we make the emotions appropriate in response to the narrative.

What are the nature and limits of knowledge concerning music (epistemology)? How do we obtain such knowledge (methodology)?

In terms of the study of music information research, some questions typically include questions about the ontology of music itself, what determines genre, distribution, etc. Standard ways of answering these questions include counting the rythmic features, comparing and contrasting them with one another. One could also compare the complexity or simplicity of music, or the music\u0026rsquo;s notation. To these traditional methods of determining what the normative features for music are, Born suggests a different notion of ontology as a method of study. For these, she suggests information that the music represents. For instance, music can represent, or possess features central to a given culture, such as those that contribute to human flourishing.\n“In this light, the article asks what computational music genre recognition or recommendation would look like if, under public-cultural or non-profit imperatives, the incentives driving them aimed to optimise imaginative self- or group development, pursuing not a logic of ‘similarity’ but diversity, or took human musical flourishing as their goals.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nSome likely possibilities include the following:\nit would optimize the imaginative self development\nor group development\nwould be diverse\nand contribute to human wellbeing\n“One theme is interdisciplinarity: how MIR would gain from closer dialogues with contemporary musicology, music anthropology and sociology. The article also considers how the ‘refresh’ might address MIR’s pursuit of research oriented to technological innovation, often linked to the drive for economic growth; concerns about sustainable economies, it argues, suggest the need for other values to guide future science and engineering.” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nAs such, it would be interdisciplinary with musicology, music anthropology and sociology.\nAsking, what are the\n“cultural backgrounds’ characterizing MIR as a field.1” ( Born, 2020, p. 193) ( pdf)\nWho are the members of the MIR community? To determine this, the Born proposes that there are four dimensions of diversity with questions about the community’s members being the first consideration:\n“The first is the one just referred to: who gets to be a member of ISMIR, which is to say, what is the demographic makeup of MIR as a profession?” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe second dimension is perhaps more sensitive than the author suggests. A further question is who gets to decide and what are the normative factors of such a decision?:\n“The second dimension of diversity is to do with whose music and which music, among the vast ocean of sounds in the world, gets to be the focus of MIR’s influential scientific practices.” ( Born, 2020, p. 195) ( pdf)\nThe third questions involves the foundational premises of the field.

Authors have argued that the narrative implicit in country music\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic is used to construct the identity of the modern American Anglo Saxon man [@mann08; @shus99; @meis22a; @gros02; @haye10; @holl19; @hugh15; @wats20b]. Critical race theorists also ask similar questions regarding the social construction of the identities of racial minorities. Agency is a central concern on both accounts. Philosophical work on narrative and identity offers a way of understanding social influence on personal identity. In some philosophical and psychological literature, agency is rooted in one\u0026rsquo;s emotional experiences upon a retelling of their life story [@alts21; @shec90; @vell05; @kors96]. More specifically, a narrative can motivate various feelings, for instance of regret [@gold09], or pride, towards actions that one did or did not do. I consider questions of agency in regards to various relational virtues.\nOne\u0026rsquo;s emotional dispositions can effectively portray the endorsement or rejection of one\u0026rsquo;s past behavior or behaviors and subsequently, an agent\u0026rsquo;s inter-relational values. For my purposes here, there are three kinds of narratives that contribute to a narrative account of agency. They include autobiographical narratives [@mcad13; @mcad14; @pasu16]. These narratives are internalized reconstructions of events. They include an emotional evaluation of such events and taken as a whole, are central to one\u0026rsquo;s understanding of who they are. It has been argued that those which are biographical and autobiographical are important for social identities and that social identity is important for moral and relational responsibility [@mcle15; @fivu04; @fivu10]. As a case in point, we can imagine one\u0026rsquo;s sense of regret or lack thereof for a falling out between best friends, or a sense of self-blame, for the awkward way in which a dinner guest leaves their house. More importantly, we might ask how such regret motivates future behavior [Especially @gold09].\nAgency too then is an important concern in questions of personhood in this regard. We can ask what are the implications of one\u0026rsquo;s personhood when person A\u0026rsquo;s agency, rather than B\u0026rsquo;s is cited as an explanation of B\u0026rsquo;s circumstances regarding their circumstances, relational and otherwise. Of course, if we only understand identity as a progression of psychological states over time, then these differences are not as significant. Therefore such distinctions would not be as important for non-personal conceptions of identity [See @parf87; and @alts21]. But if we think that narrative and agency are important, or important sources for one\u0026rsquo;s own sense of identity, e.g. autobiographical vs biographical narrative, then emotional dispositions and their social constraints are central to human behavior. As such, narratives may be central to moral and interpersonal or inter-relational responsibility. Importantly, this is because they are central to one\u0026rsquo;s past emotional dispositions and can effectively endorse pro or anti-social behaviors.\nHowever, the sources of narrative is unclear. In regards to the relationship between narrative and identity, some are said to be biographical (personal) while others autobiographical (social) [@mcle15b]. Therefore, correspondingly, we might think that there is a missed opportunity in the existing philosophical literature on race to remark on the importance of relational agency as inferred by attributed social identities and how individuals navigate these. One area in the social construction of race where there could be more discussion, are the various characterizations of racial minorities regarding interpersonal relationship constitutions as inferred by their social identities. What does the familial structure of the typical racial minority look like according to popular culture for instance? What emotions are central to the breakup of a relationship and what emotions are central to companionship?\nI consider extracted sentiment to understand represented relational term objects in popular art [@moha21]. This will enable us to visualize emotionally valenced relational content. By analyzing the sentiment content of music lyrics, I attempt to extract those phrases that artists attach the most sentient to. These include both negatively and positively valenced cultural ascriptions of the social values among members of various populations. I ask what contributions do these make in the construction of social identities. By determining the valence, emotions, and other affectual attributions from music lyrics, I suggest that a more comprehensive project in this area will go further towards determining the portrayed broader cultural attitudes about inter-relational dispositions of minority cultures.\nWhile there is significant criticism regarding insufficient representation in media publishing, there is not similar concern for expressions of pro vs anti-social emotion expression. Some have previously attempted to explain human agency as a central aspect of personal identity by narratives both autobiographical and biographical [@mcle15b; @book22a; @brun90; @alts21; @vell05a]. This project continues that work by asking what values are suggested through an analysis of sentiment in important cultural artifacts. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, I primarily focus on popular music. Here, constructions of social identity necessarily entail relational agency more broadly. I suggest that such a study will go towards revealing the importance of broader cultural ascriptions of the relationships that exist between members of a given culture.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/books/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/","title":"Morton's Emotion and Imagination","section":"Books","content":" What is the link between emotion and imagination?

It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware.

Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":28,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":" Step 1.

[Morton, 206]\nIn order to avoid what Morton calls moral smugness, a vice that undermines second-personal knowledge, we must practice what he calls emotional unbundling. It is a virtue that requires that we take motives from which our own emotions are constructed and attribute them as much as it is possible to someone else\u0026rsquo;s.\nA person acts, moved by shame, approval, condemnation, or some other moral emotion. Another person tries to understand, and perhaps to anticipate the next action. But she knows that if she were acting from shame, condemnation, or approval, she would do something very different. Perhaps what he calls shame is leading him to public confession rather than wanting to hide; perhaps what he calls condemnation is leading him to teasing rather than attack. One possibility the second person must face is that his shame, or condemnation, is not hers. Perhaps they are different emotions with some family resemblance. Part of the evidence that a similar but different emotion was at work could be that the second person managed to imagine such an emotion and it fitted. But to get this evidence, she would have to be able to do the imagining.\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/docs/materials/morality-of-wellbeing/","title":"The Morality of Emotional-Wellbeing","section":"Standalone Papers","content":" Narratives take place all around us. They can occur in news publications when anchors and journalist establish a story about why inflation is high, but entertainment recommender systems rely on a given narrative to make suggestions to us. In previous decades, traditional radio hosts and DJs were more responsible for determining what a given population would listen to. We now know however, that there is more extensive corporate influence in the entirety of the music production process, from production to distribution, to audience listening habits. A remaining question, then, is what effects these realities portray. One potential answer involves narratives, with researchers of psychology and philosophy recognizing the ways in which narratives shape our self-identity and infuse our lives with meaning. As such, narratives can potentially constitute a key component of our own psychological development, meaning that corporate influence in the creation of mass narratives is an important topic for human wellbeing.\nIn my research, I consider the relationship between the emotional bonds among a community’s members and particular narratives central to those communities. I argue that narratives are crucial to culture, identity, and community, each of which are essential for well-being and as such, are a source of what I call moral knowledge. My research has two components. First, it explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives. Regarding this component, I am interested in all facets of public narrative, from popular music to the twenty-four-hour news cycle. The second component uses tools often used by data analysts, such as sentiment analysis (e.g., quanteda), it looks to deconstruct linguistic corpuses, and to contrast the emotional features of a given lyric corpus in response to moral kind terms in the expression of human relationships. Adopting a broadly sentimentalist moral perspective, I build upon the insights of narrative scholars like Eleonore Stump (2020), Martha Nussbaum, Mohamad Syed and Kate McLean, and other digital humanists like Marc Alfano. I propose an account where human well-being plays a vital role in questions of moral knowledge.\n"}]

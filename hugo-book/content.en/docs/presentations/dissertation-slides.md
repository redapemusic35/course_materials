# Imagining Moral Prescriptions and Invariance

#### Does Imaginative Function Explain Emotional Variance?

> He didn’t answer so I gently lifted his head. He toppled backward onto the earth. He had been bleeding from the mouth, and his neck and the front of his shirt were stained a brilliant red. “Doodle, Doodle.” There was no answer but the ropy rain. I began to weep, and the tear-blurred vision in red before me looked very familiar. “Doodle\!” I screamed above the pounding storm and threw my body to the earth above his. For a long time, it seemed forever, I lay there crying, sheltering my fallen scarlet ibis

I want to argue that the difference is one of vulnerability. And as narratives, some teach interrelational vulnerability while others do not.

One is about the expression of human vulnerability

The other about whether there is a normative function associated with the expression of human vulnerability

Whether there is an obligation that overrides under functions to do so.

But, the important question is whether one satisfies a norm or an obligation that another does not.

The alternative:

> The opponents of luck assert that the good human life is completely involverable to *tuch-{e}*. That which we ourselves control is in every case sufficient to secure it.

So when Agammenon has his daughter murdered, it appears as though his sin was just that action. But the tragedy would have us believe that his actions were out of his control and as such, he deserves no more blame than had he slaughtered a calf to satisfy his hunger. But . . .

> so \[though\] a human being might slaughter cattle: without compunction and to satisfy immediate needs\[, w\]hen the victims are human, we expect deliberations and feelings of greater complexity to be involved. \[Nus01; 10\]

And as such, it is not so much that his goodness was always vulnerable to luck, but rather,

> complete invulnerability is purchased, Aristotle will argue, at too high a price: by imagining (as does Platonist) a life bereft of certain important values; or by doing violence (as does the good-condition theorist) to our beliefs about activity and its worth.

His mistake is failing to recognize his vulnerability, in this case, his need for relationship with his daughter.

In teaching interrelational vulnerability, they are a source of moral testimony.

More importantly however, some song lyrics can undermine moral testimony by teaching vicious self-sufficiency. A form of ingratitude and undermining an individual’s ability to recognize the importance of others in their lives.

## Two common concerns

1.  The correctness of an emotional expression towards objects in real life.
2.  The correctness of an emotional expression towards objects that we only imagine.

### Approach 2, Normative Invariance

#### The emotions are real, **and** governed by the same set of norms, e.g., *affective appraisal*.

  - “An emotion is justified when experienced in response to an object in a fiction if and only if the emotion is justified in response to an analogous object in the actual world.”

???

We might think that at first, this criticism applies to both Stump and Nussbaum. Namely, when we look at the expression of a given emotion in fiction, we might think that any emotion expressing, for instance insensitivity to others, is a real emotion grounded in a set of social norms. Looking at the first example, the expression of insensitivity to the plight of another should motivate some blame mechanism. The narrator would then be critized for their insensitivity. Further, we could expect that many criticisms of rap would then be criticisms of this insensitivity.

“An emotion is justified when experienced in response to an object in a fiction if and only if the emotion is justified in response to an analogous object in the actual world.”

–

> Although there is usually lots of cognitive activity going on in the course of an emotion process, the process itself is always initiated by an automatic affective appraisal that occurs prior to reflection. It is because emotions are triggered by an automatic affective appraisal that they are in some important ways immune to assessment as rational or irrational: they are, as Edith Wharton suggests in the epigraph, ‘deeper than reason’. \[Rob05\]

According to Gilmore, this means that the imaginative activity associated with appreciating works of art, has functions that are associated with the pursuit of moral truth. But this is a claim that he rejects.

Arguing instead that this imaginative activity sometimes has other functions such as entertainment, absorption, vicarious experience, distraction etc.

But other functions could include for instance, dual character concepts in which artists are discussents participating in a linguistic activity of negotiating a community’s values and practical identity.

Importantly here however is the fact that such a function would be only one possible function out of many possible functions.

So the question here, is whether a pursuit of moral truth can override all other functions, or whether there *is* a fundamental function for appraising art.

While my emotional engagement with a given context in the real world works according to a particular set of norms, whatever these might be, my emotional engagement with fictions work according to another set of norms.

This is because the norms governing my engagements are determined by whatever functions those engagements are intended to fulfill.

There may be one set of norms for entertainment and another set of norms for moral (or philosophical) instruction.

However, this means that works of art and our engagements with them do not have functions.

  - Accepting a cogntive theory of the imagination, imagination like other faculties is type identified by its intended function

???

  - in some cases one’s imaginative activity has an epistemic or practical role like that of beliefs and perceptions, where the function is to aid in, e.g., planning for the future, or discovering some truth about the actual world, our evaluative commitments, or what is metaphycially possible. Those aims are better realized if one’s emotions are (1) based on reasons that speak to the qualities of their object, (2) not the arrational result of some independent cause.

The Red Ibis is a warning against callousness. It admonishes us to always be sympathetic to the needs and cries of others.

Especially those that are close to us, such as family members. We might think that such responses are natural, and that they do not need to be taught.

But in the Red Ibis, it wasn’t a natural emotional response to the narrator.

It wasn’t until the end that he recognized the importance his little brother held for him.

  - One way, emotions are evaluative representations that prescribe e.g., gratitude as worthy of a positive moral sentiment = therefore ascribing value,
  - The ascription of value tells us that gratitude is morally admirable

In the first stanza above, I can imagine that selfish actions warrant:

  - moral praise

  - positive sentiment

class: middle

1.  Imaginings are type-identified by their functional roles, a given imagining is determined by the artist’s use of aesthetic convention, therefore there are both internal and external sources of truth in a fictive utterance.
2.  Emotion is an evaluative mental state, whereby we can also emotionally evaluate the contents of our imaginations. Yet, because “the imaginative representations responsible for causing a fiction-directed emotion may arise along with factors” differ from those that cause an emotion directed at some object in the real world, there is an asymmatry between emotions generated by fiction and the real world.
    An example of internal and external sources of truth could be seen in James Hurst’s *The Red Ibis*.

???

Hurst’s use of the juxtaposition between the death of the Red Ibis under the “bleeding tree” and the stain of blood on Doodle’s shirt under “the red nightshade bush” to let us know of Doodle’s definite death.

The juxtaposition is an external source of truth informing us of Doodle’s death.

In addition, deaths of loved ones are typically sad, and the juxtaposition is used to facilitate this emotion in us.

This lets us know that here, that we too, ought to feel sad.

While the narrator is an inner source of truth regarding the sadness we know is present, the juxtaposition is an outer source of this truth.

> young children can have moral knowledge even if they are not in a position to justify the moral views that they kow, in the sense of providing compelling reasons in support of those moral views.

#### Testimony

> She finds that others follow certain norms and hold certain views, and she adopts these norms and views as her own, typically without much in the way of critical reflection.

???

But we might worry about what makes it rational to adopt the norms of others. It cannot be merely that adopting these beliefs are rational because of some prescriptive norm for that would be circular.

class: middle

1.  Knowledge that something is the right thing to do is grounded in an appreciation of or sensitivity to the features that make `\(\phi\)`-ing the right thing to do.
2.  When a person defers to another about the weather, or about geography, or about some esoteric scientific matter, her doing so does not similarly frustrate the achievement of any ideal associated with agency.

???

But there is a way to escape the vicious circularity.

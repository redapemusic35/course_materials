See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy And youre doing your best to avoid me Im starting to think one day, Ill tell the story of us Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here But you held your pride like you shouldve held me  Oh, Im scared to see the ending Why are we pretending this is nothing?

Yeah,  I dont know what to say Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now (now, now, now) Oh (Now, now, now)  And were not speaking And Im dying to know Is it killing you like its killing me, yeah?

Lyrics  You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors Its the mornin of your very first day You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while Try and stay out of everybodys way Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here For the next four years in this town Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say You know, I havent seen you around before  Cause when youre fifteen

greater than Dating the boy on the football team But I didnt know it at fifteen  When all you wanted was to be wanted Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday But I realized some bigger dreams of mine And Abigail gave everything she had To a boy who changed his mind And we both cried  Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you Youre gonna believe them And when youre fifteen, dont forget to look before you fall Ive found time can heal most anything And you just might find who youre supposed to be I didnt

missing you Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine Id go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time  These days I havent been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didnt call And I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall  And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying Im sorry for that night And Id go back to December all the time It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine Id go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again I swear Id love you right Id go back in time and change it, but I cant So if the chain is on your door, I

And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me  And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to  Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it

well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well  Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah  Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well  Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the

said youd be here  And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And theyre all laughing As Im looking around the room But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew  And the hours pass by Now I just wanna be alone But your close friends always seem to know When theres something really wrong So they follow me down the hall And there in the bathroom I try not to fall apart And the sinking feeling starts As I say hopelessly He said hed be here  And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And theyre all laughing And asking me about you But there was one thing missing (Missing) And that was the moment I knew  What do you say When tears are streaming down your face

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip . This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you . The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness.  Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old.  On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people.  On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing . When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test.  There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us . There will be no further explanation . There will be just reputation . 14 Embed', 'If Youre Anything Like Me  Lyrics If youre anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when youre nervous. You promise people the world, because thats what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If youre anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If youre anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If youre anything like me, Theres a justice system in your head For names youll never speak again, And you make your  ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If youre anything like me Youve grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If youre anything like me, You couldnt recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If youre anything like me, Im sorry. But Darling, its going to be okay. 24 Embed', 'King Of My Heart Lyrics  Im perfectly fine, I live on my own I made up my mind, Im better off bein alone We met a few weeks ago Now you try on callin me Baby like tryin on clothes  Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do  And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa  And all at once, Ive been waiting, waiting Ooh whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once  Late in the night, the citys asleep Your love is a secret Im hoping, dreaming, dying to keep Change my priorities The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury  Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh) Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)  And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa  And all at once (Hey), Ive been waiting, waiting (Waiting) Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting) Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once  Is this the end of all the endings?

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right. Whatever you do, it is not enough. Your kindness is fake. Your pain is manipulative. When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here. And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive. 28 Embed', 'Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics  I dont like your little games Dont like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I dont like you I dont like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh)  But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Im yours to keep And Im yours to lose You know Im not a bad girl, but I Do bad things with you So it goes...  Met you in a bar All eyes on me, your illusionist All eyes on us I make all your gray days clear And wear you like a necklace Im so chill, but you make me jealous But I got your heart Skippin, skip-skippin when Im gone  Cause we break down a little But when I get you alone, its so simple Cause baby, I know what you know We can feel it  And all the pieces fall right into place Getting caught up in a moment Lipstick on your face So it goes... Im yours to keep And Im yours to lose You know Im not a bad girl, but I Do bad things with you So it goes...

I was writing with two writers I hadnt ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called I Forgot That You Existed, and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that youve been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize youre indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started  I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice (Humming) I forgot that you existed I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice I forgot that you existed How Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice So peaceful and How many nights I, how you did me How many days did I wait thinking Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?

Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it.

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later.   Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down.   The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it.   The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.   A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor.   A whiskey bottle beckoning.   Hands held through plastic.   A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt.   An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong .  An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession .  A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize .  Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line .  My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942 .  A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around.  Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve Now its up to you to pass them down Embed', 'dorothea Lyrics  Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?

Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild  I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate Youre my Achilles heel This is the golden age of something good and right and real  And I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same, oh Oh, I never saw

Version) Lyrics  I remember your bare feet, down the hallway I remember your little laugh Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs I love you to the moon and back I remember your blue eyes looking into mine Like we had our own secret club I remember you dancing before bedtime Then jumping on me, waking me up I can still feel you hold my hand, little man And even the moment I knew You fought it hard like an army guy Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  Come on, baby, with me Were going to fly away from here You were my best four years  I remember the drive home When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, Why? Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say About a beautiful boy who died And its about to be Halloween You could be anything you wanted if you were still here I remember the last day, when I kissed your face And whispered in your ear  Come on, baby, with me Were going to fly away from here Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray Well just disappear Come on, baby, with me Were going to fly away from here You were my best four years  What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you? And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you wont grow into? And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through? What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

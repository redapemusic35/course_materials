# TSwift Mac-D

Other moral foundations theories look at other factors of morality such
as intuitions (Hopp et al. 2021). The *morality as cooperation*
foundations dictionary developed by Mark Alfano is a natural language
process that is intended to detect fundamental character traits in terms
of moral cooperation (For moral cooperation, see O. S. Curry 2016; O.
Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019).[1] Here, I analyze a set of music
lyrics by Taylor Swift using the morality as cooperation dictionary,
MAC-D, developed by Alfano, Cheong, and Curry (2022).

According to the ethical theory *morality as cooperation* (O. S. Curry
2016), humans over time have faced a number of problems necessitating
the need for cooperation (O. Curry, Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). In
response to these needs, humans and other anthropoids evolved methods
for cooperation that act as solutions to these problems. As the theory
continues, across all societies, we can identify traits that evolved in
humans in light of these environmental needs (Shultz, Opie, and Atkinson
2011). The forms these evolved characteristics take are cooperative
behaviors that resemble character traits, strategies, dispositions,
behaviors, rules, norms, institutions, and technologies.

1.  family values

> Kin selection explains why we love and care for our families, why
> parents feel a duty of care to their offspring, why we feel a special
> obligation to help our extended families, and why we abhor incest
> (Hamilton, 1964; Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2003).

1.  group loyalty

> Mutualism explains why we coordinate our activities to pursue projects
> of mutual interest, why we form groups, clubs, and coalitions (there
> is strength and safety in numbers), why we value these groups, their
> members, and our membership in them, why we adopt local norms and
> conventions, why we feel a special obligation to come to the aid of
> group members, and why we value loyalty, unity and solidarity (Lewis,
> 1969; Royce, 1908).

1.  reciprocity

> Social exchange explains why we seek opportunities for
> mutually-beneficial trade, and why we feel we ought to trust others,
> return favours (positive reciprocity), keep promises, pay debts,
> fulfil contracts, be grateful for favours received, feel guilty for
> favours not returned, avenge injuries (negative reciprocity), punish
> cheats, apologise for causing injuries, and forgive those who
> apologise (Cosmides & Tooby, 2005;Trivers, 1971).

1.  heroism
2.  defense

> Conflict resolution explains why we minimise the mutual costs of
> disputes by engaging in ritual contests: why we proudly display cues
> of power and high status (‘excellences’, including bravery and
> generosity); and, when bested, why we express humility, and respect,
> defer, and submit to our superiors (Curry, 2007; Sznycer et al.,
> 2017).

1.  fairness

> Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes over
> divisible resources by dividing or sharing them (often resulting in
> equal shares), and hence why we feel an obligation to negotiate, seek
> a compromise, and be fair (Messick, 1993; Skyrms, 1996).

1.  property rights

> Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes by
> recognising prior possession, hence why we feel we ought to respect
> others’ property and territory, and refrain from theft (Gintis, 2007).

The morality as cooperation view predicts that there will be the same
number of types of morality as there are of cooperation (O. Curry,
Chesters, and Van Lissa 2019). They test this hypothesis using a content
analysis of 600 ethnographic accounts of 60 societies chosen at random
from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (*eHRAF*). To test this
hypothesis, rather than using the hand code holographic method
(Otterbein 1978; Ember and Ember (2009)) used by O. Curry, Chesters, and
Van Lissa (2019), Alfano predicts that they can use natural language
processing, more specifically the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
method developed by James W. Pennebaker et al. (2015).[2] LIWC combs
through a text and counts the number of words belonging to a given
category. For instance, LIWC has been used to count the number of first
person pronouns, psychological processes such as positive and negative
emotions, and discreet emotions. It relies on a given dictionary
provided by the user which instructs the kinds of words to be counted.

Moral corpora is typically used by LIWC users to count moral terms using
the *Moral Foundations Dictionary* \[MFD\], for instance Hoover et all
use MFD to comb tweets for 5 domains and Padfield and Buchanan (2020)
use MFD to characterize the moral lean of US news organizations.
However, MFD is limited in a number of ways, not having foundations for
family values, reciprocity, heroism, or property rights. In addition,
there are interrater reliability issues. Given these issues, Alfano *et
al* created the *Morality as Cooperation Dictionary* (MAC-D).

First they brainstormed words aligning with the seven basic moral
principles hypothesized by Curry *et al*. These include loving your
family, being loyal to your group, returning favours, exercising courage
and generosity, showing deference to superiors, being fair in the
distribution of resources, and respecting property. They next used the
software program WordNet, which is a large English language lexical
database. When given a word or phase, Wordnet generates synsets that can
be used to search related terms according to a given category: synonyms,
hyponyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc.

### eHRAF

eHRAF is an archive of thousands of full text ethnographies (Lagace
1979). Alfano *et al* also relied on these ethnographic accounts to test
the terms in MAC-D. To do so, they extracted 331 paragraphs from eHRAF
that were labeled as *ethics* resulting in 1,620,644 words from 9,653,
paragraphs, from 1,389 documents, covering 256 societies, 8 cultural
regions, following 9 subsistence strategies. They then used the MAC
dictionary to calculate the percentage of words from each paragraph that
was found in one or more of the seven foundation dictionaries.

## Building a Dataset

I have several datasets comprised of Taylor Swift song lyrics. One of
these is organized by year. A good question that is available to us
using this dataset, is whether there are computationally significant
differences between Swift’s earlier songs and more recent ones. One kind
of difference we can discern could be whether her moral commitments
changed according to the MAC-D. For instance, does she make more
references to family values in her earlier songs than she does her later
ones.

broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights  Ive seen a million things Spoke a million words Now I only want to speak to you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  Still through the haze I can make out constellations Ill make one of you and me as we sit in the sand And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights  Ive played a thousand songs Sang a thousand words Now I only want to sing to you Waited on a wire Staring at the fire Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  Ive walked a thousand miles Smiled a thousand smiles Now I only smile when Im with you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  So walk with me as the sweet wind dances Ill write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights 1 Embed', 'Lucky You Lyrics  Theres a little girl in this little town With a little too much heart to go around Live forever, never say never You could do better, thats what she says  Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you  She sings her little song, she walks along A little pathway headed for the skies Left to travels, lives they unravel Mind over matter, thats what she says  Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do Lucky you, lucky you  Maybe shell sing you do-do-do-do Maybe shell bring you into the skies Honey shell love you, funny how some view Angels above you arent so far away  Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite Of the fact that shes different And yet shes the same And she says, lucky you, lucky you Embed', 'American Boy Lyrics  American boy, living life as it goes Sitting on the fence posts Living in the lie American boy, living in the real world Trying just to get the girl Trying to survive  The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero

survive  The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy  Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships Looking for the love Suddenly rise, an American beauty Suddenly he cheats, sent from above  The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Sam Hill avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world can ever once destroy The hope of an American boy  American boy, raising little babies Hearing daddy maybe, Ill be like you Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn Thats grown up, American boy  The simple things in life are always new Growing up on Grandview avenue Mama makes her cookies and daddys just The greatest living hero that ever was Nothing in the world will ever once destroy No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy The hope of an American boy 1 Embed', 'Point of View Lyrics Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door But mamas watch is ticking off the wall Jillian and Bobby think that theyre a perfect pair But girls could say hes just a bit too tall You dont have to do to win big You just have to think it Some folks say the glass is half full Others choose to drink it Some say the grass could be greener And the other side aint far away But I say the old could be newer And love still counts when it doesnt stay Some say I love you Some say love needs proof Its all in your point of view He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes His NFL was turned to TLC Babys got an attitude and thinks they just dont know But they all do and wish that she could see You dont have to do to win big You just have to think it Some folks say the glass is half full Others choose to drink it Some say the grass could be greener And the other side aint far away But I say the old could be newer And love still counts when it doesnt stay Some say I love you Some say love needs proof Its all in your point of view In the least or masterpiece Depends on ones opinion Worst of all they never call But dont think that they werent wishing Some say the grass could be greener And the other side aint far away But I say the old could be newer And love still counts when it doesnt stay Some say I love you Some say love needs proof

and watch me cry Watch me fall and watch me fly Cause Im living in a brand new world And you think Im just another girl But Im living just a day at a time And keeping it mine Someday Im gonna fly  Watch me catch a star and pin it down Watch me live another time around Watch me doubt the things I love Watch me find what Im proud of Cause Im living in a brand new world And you think Im just another girl But Im living just a day at a time And keeping it mine Someday Im gonna fly  And I may break my wings And fall flat on my shattered heart And I may hit the ground But I will never fall

So what have you got that I aint? And what do you do that I cant? Lets put me and you in an empty room And see who wins Lets talk about what you did to get here Lets talk about blood, and sweat, and tears Lets talk about who you want to be, girl And who Ive always

the truth would hurt my eyes It wouldve been good for you to be there And every time you always would Everything seems to have a picture perfect time And nothing seems to be a blur  Its hard to see a

Happy (Taylors Version)  Lyrics  We used to walk along the streets When the porch lights were shining bright Before I had somewhere to be Back when we had all night and we were happy I do recall a good while back,   we snuck into the circus You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it And we were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday And we were happy  We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water Thats sorta how I feel right now And goodbyes so much harder cause we were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday And we were happy We were happy  Oh, I hate those voices telling me Im not in love anymore But they dont give me choices and thats what these tears are for Cause we were happy We were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm And you were gonna marry me And we were happy We were happy Oh-oh-oh-oh We were happy 18 Embed', 'What To Wear Lyrics  Shes looking in the mirror The moments getting nearer She thinks about it as she walks her walk Up and down the staircase Make up fresh on her face She thinks about it as she talks her talk  School dance, first chance Always been a dreamer Theres one guy, shes shy Sees him through the mirror And everybody looks at her She thinks about it Blue dress, angel face Looking in the mirror Shoes, purse, hair tied back And you should see her Shes got her magic Floating through the air  Peace, love One thing leads into another Dream big, aim small Man you got to love her Shes got her hopes up Got them up to there Wondering what to wear  Shes standing in her bedroom Hell be pulling up soon She thinks about it when she sees headlights Looking out the window Shes got her diary to show That shes been waiting for this all her life First date, cant wait Looking in the mirror Heart all wrapped up Wait until he sees her Hes looking right at her She thinks about it Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt Shoes, purse, hair tied back And you should see her Shes got her magic Floating through the air   The years went by The mirror saw her cry She got up again She got up again The wind blew by The small town lights She got up again Move out, find out Where the world can take her Bright lights, late nights Living for the greater Move to Paris Living on a prayer  Peace, love One thing leads into another Dream big, aim small Man you got to love her Shes got her hopes up Got them up to there Shes got her hopes up Got them up to there Wondering what to wear  Oh, oh, oh Wondering what to wear Embed', 'Never Mind Lyrics  Look at you, look at me Look at who we could be I want to know who you are What you

that what I feel is true And Im only me when Im with you  When Im with anybody else Its so hard to be myself And only you can tell  That Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me Who I wanna be Well Im only me when

my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  And Im back for the first time since then Im standin on your street And theres a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that youll read is: When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song Someday youll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place  When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me Oh, think of me Mmmm  He said the way my blue eyes shine Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, Thats a lie 24 Embed', 'A Place In This World Lyrics  I dont know what I want, so dont ask me Cause Im still trying to figure it out Dont know whats down this

What if happiness came in a cardboard box? Then I think there is something we all forgot What would happen if presents all went away? Tell me, what would you find?

 Friday night beneath the stars In a field behind your yard You and I are painting pictures in the sky And sometimes we dont say a thing Just listen to the crickets sing Everything I need is right here by my side  And I know everything about you I dont wanna live without you  Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me when Im with you  Just a small-town boy and girl Livin in a crazy world Tryna figure out what is and isnt true And I dont try to hide my tears My secrets or my deepest fears Through it all, nobody gets me like you do  And you know everything about me You say that you cant live without me  Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me when Im with you  When Im with anybody else Its so hard to be myself And only you can tell  That Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me Who I wanna be Well Im only me when Im with you  With you Uh-huh-huh, yeah 10 Embed', 'You Belong with Me Lyrics  Youre on the phone with your girlfriend, shes upset Shes going off about something that you said Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do Im in the room, its a typical Tuesday night Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like And shell never know your story like I do  But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts Shes Cheer

## Mac-D Analysis

Next, we run a preliminary analysis on the dataset using the Mac-D. The
first column to the left are the years for which a given set of songs
was recorded. So for instance, according to
[genius.com](https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-american-boy-lyrics#primary-album),
in 2002, Swift recorded songs like *American Boy*.

<img src="https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/340x340/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F2c31af7699fe6a049b4cb660046b1910.497x497x1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Afterwards, *segment* refers to year year, *WPS* equals the mean number
of words per sentence. This is a bit off as periods are not usually used
to denote sentence length. In the second iteration of the analysis, I
can easily use a grep function to input punctuation at the most logical
places for it.

*WC* refers to the total number of words in the dataset for that year.
So for instance, 2002 shows a total of 776 words while 2011 shows a
total of 11,486 words.

*Sixltr* refers to words with greater than six letters representing more
formal writing. What this means is that documents with a higher
percentage of words with greater than six letters are more likely to be
formal documents. I do not think that you can get any less formal than
music lyrics, but this might then mean that music lyrics are better a
representing emotional states.

title: "Philosophy Through MMOs"
---

Philosophers have debated the purpose and importance of philosophical thought experiments. Unlike your standard fiction, a philosophical thought experiment is a fiction without all of the extra layers of fluff. A case in point is the trolley example. According to it, there is a train track that diverges into separate tracks. There is a nearby lever capable of diverting oncoming train from its intended path to an alternate one. There are five innocent people tied to the track. Unless you pull the lever and divert the trolley, these five innocent people will be killed. However, there is one innocent person on the alternate path that will be killed should you pull the level.

Traditional fictions will possibly tell us who the people on the track are. A fiction might tell us the eye color of the people on the track, what they were wearing, perhaps why they are on the tracks to begin with. It has been questioned whether philosophers should take fictions more seriously like they do philosophical thought experiments. A reason why you might not, is that fiction may change your world view for the wrong reasons. Philosophical argument and rhetoric quarantine the important factors, and so if you change your mind on some topic due to philosophical argument and reason, then you will have done so for the right reasons, which philosophy can make plain to us.

### Introduction

In his *Apt Imaginings*, John Gilmore defends an account of normative discontinuity in art. According to this account, the criteria governing our affective engagements with the world are not qualitatively the same as the criteria governing our affective engagements with fiction. This means that make-believing is not epistemically rational in the same sense as believing. Deriving pleasure from a fictional scene, when another would not do so in an analogous event in real-life, is not evidence of a moral failure.

Gilmore defends this account arguing that the moral value of a work of art is grounded in the purpose and function that it was created to realize.

> I suggest that we can discover an internal relation between the artistic and moral value of a work in the relation between, broadly speaking, the moral vision of a work of art and the point, purpose, or function it was created to realize.

Considering whether some works of art have moral flaws or not, Gilmore argues that such defects are instantiated by the failure of the artist to accurately represent some content. But this says nothing about works of art that do not intend to represent moral content, but rather work towards realizing some divergent end, say entertainment, or financial capital through popularity and sales.

> Thus, there are some kinds of reasons that justify an emotion felt toward a state of affairs represented in a fiction or imagining that would not justify that emotion when felt toward an analogous state of affairs in the real world.

As such, it is not clear how to criticize such works of art.

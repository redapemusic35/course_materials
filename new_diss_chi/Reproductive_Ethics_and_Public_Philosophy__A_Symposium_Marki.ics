The intervening years have seen an efflorescence of excellent philosophical work on reproductive ethics and policy\, as well as of the publicly engaged mode of philosophy that Warnock\n practiced and championed. This APA Live event\, a collaboration between the APA and the Journal of Applied Philosophy\, marks Warnock’s centenary (1924-2019) with a presentation and discussion of exciting new applied philosophical work on reproductive\n ethics and policy\, and reflections on Warnock’s legacy. Introduced and moderated by Prof. David Archard (Queen’s University Belfast)\, the webinar features four younger scholars presenting new work on the frontiers of procreative ethics. The webinar\n also celebrates the 40th anniversary of the JOAP\, a leading outlet for philosophical work in all areas of applied philosophy.\n The panelists for this event are as follows:\n David Archard (facilitator)\nProfessor Emeritus of Philosophy\, Queen’s University Belfast\nVice President of the Society for Applied Philosophy\n Reuven Brandt\nAssociate Professor of Philosophy\, University of California San Diego\n Megan Louise Kitts\nClinical Ethics Fellow\, Baylor College of Medicine\n Benjamin Lange\nResearch Assistant Professor of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence\, LMU Munich\n Olivia Schuman\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\, University of Louisville\nClinical Ethicist\, Norton Health Care\nThe event will be held on Wednesday\, October 16\, 2024\, 12 noon Eastern / 11 a.m. Central / 9 a.m. Pacific.

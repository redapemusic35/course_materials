<p>It may not be initially clear, but this video is about philosophy . . . and the MMO Star Citizen. What does the one have to do with the other? In my previous video, I briefly expressed the hope that virtual game worlds can be used to teach us about our intuitions. However, many may justifiably think that this is a fools errand. They are going to say that philosophical exploration and analysis requires that we leave the extra curricular behind. That the virtue of the philosophical method is its semantic precision. Each word choosen for a specific purpose, that only that word could fulfill in that context. This philosophical insight requires that we directly articulate the nature of a given problem, and clearly and concisely explain counter examples, expressing our reasons in a way they can be understood by anyone, and that there force is immediately recognized, it enables a special kind of insight.</p>
<p>Welcome to the next episode. If you recall, in the previous episode, which you will see a link for here; we discussed the puzzle of imaginative use, which is a question about how a game’s trancendent properties help us to learn something about the real world.</p>
<p>As I alluded to in that video, Star Citizen is an ambitious Space MMO, which makes it something like a communally played game. But you don’t have to <em>play</em> the game, and that, in my opinion is what makes it special. So what game will we play instead?</p>
<p>When I was younger, there were games like Mario World, The Legend of Zelda, Pong. These games gave you a well defined goal, and specific constraints that were placed on you in completing a goal. In order to participate, you had to play the game.</p>
<p>You could not harvest the plants in Zelda, or cut down the flag pole at the end of the first level in Mario, build a home in Pong, etc. You could play other games, for instance performing a speed run where the object is not to kill the npcs, but to get to the end as quickly as possible. You could kill only blue targets, or avoid leveling up for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Many games coming out now, attempt to give the player as many choices as possible, many more than these other player defined choices. More importantly, by doing so, we are not running afoul of the aims of the developer. The developer wants us to define our own objectives. So <em>these</em> choices aren’t just choices about how to progress through the game, they include choices about what progression through game means for the player.</p>
<p>Star Citizen is like this. I might have a goal to fly to Microtech, sit on the bank of a stream and eat lunch. I’ve experienced watching the sun rise on the surface of a moon and taken note of the difference in build quality for a ship like the 890 Jump and Drake Cutter. Some of my more memorable moments in the game have consisted of reflecting on and admiring the wood paneling embedded seamlessly in the floor running along the edge of the carpet in the former, in contrast to the riveted paneling in the latter. But what do such experiences, experiences of trancendence, have for learning facts about the real world? This is a puzzle, hum.</p>
<p>Philosophy is filled with puzzles, from Meno’s paradox, to the problem of other minds and the experience machine to mention a few. The puzzle of imaginative use questions why one mental faculty, namely imagination, can be used for both transcendence, play, absorption, entertainment, and instruction, planning, discovery.</p>
<p>Does a game like Star Citizen offer a better chance at teaching me something since it does afford me more opportunities to engage my imagination than Mario Kart Racing.</p>
<p>In Star Citizen, I could race, say for instance if I decided to participate in one of the yearly races on Daymar, or I could refrain from doing so and lay down in the grass and gaze up at the sky through the leaves of a forest on Micro Tech.</p>
<p>More importantly, how can a mental faculty that seems primarily dedicated to pleasure, experiencing my reflection on a simulated pool of water, and entertainment for instance flying a Terrapin with my friends, and absorption grinding a mining loop so that I can save up for the Origin 325i, uses which are transcendent, also be used for instruction, such as when planning for the future. What can Star Citizen teach me about the real world? The hear and now? The twenty-first century? While I might learn what ship to purchase, or discover what I should take with me when embarking on a mission in Star Citizen, say food and water, do I also learn what car I might purchase when considering a new business endeavor, or what to take with me when driving cross-country to visit in-laws in the real-world?</p>
<p>In a collection of views about the potential for the instructive uses of the imagination, Amy Kind and Peter Kung in <em>Knowledge Through Imagination</em>, argue that the way forward, explaining the instructive use of the imagination, requires being able to recognize when constraints are placed on imagination.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When the proper constraints are put into place, then imagination can help us “discover truths about the real world”. It is not initially clear what these constraints might be at the outset however, but if this is true, then Star Citizen should have restrictions in place to satisfy the epistemological aims of man-kind.</p>
<p>Fortunately however, I think that their solution does appear to be what Star Citizen is aiming for in its game-play. Namely modeling the real-world where choices are not forced and outcomes are not indefinitely fixed. Initially then, it might be difficult to square this with the solution suggested earlier, that to explain the instructive use of the imagination, we have to first be able to recognize what constraints exist in the game. Only when we understand what is metaphysically impossible, do we begin to understand what is metaphsyically possible and thereby discover through imagination, something true about the real-world.</p>
<p>Continuing on, in future videos, I will explore other attempts at solving the puzzle. These include the equivocation view, three historical treatments including Descartes, Hume, and Kant. Three contemporary views, including Kendall Walton, some Modalist views, and mind-reading, or knowledge or other minds, whichever locution you prefer. Finally, we will look at Kind and Kung’s own suggested constraints and ask ourselves how these views are exemplified in the Star Citizen universe.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Equivocating Solutions to the Puzzle<a href="equivocation-and-imagination.html#equivocating-solutions-to-the-puzzle" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>One helpful way to understand the philosophical discipline, is to first recognize how enduring philosophical questions have been divided up into subdisciplines.</p>
<p>These include Metaphyics which include questions about the nature of reality, Epistemology which includes questions about the nature of knowledge, Value theory, questions about the nature of what we value, or what is valuable.</p>
<p>Included in these questions are those about ethics, right, good, etc., aesthetics, beauty, etc., etc. and so on. For a helpful outline, you can peruse <a href="https://www.philpapers.org">PhilPapers</a>.</p>
<p>Given that we are talking about games, we might be asking questions about art, the beautiful, and representation. But while this is plausible, and there are very good discussions about video games and video game properties (including one that I hope to do a video in the near future on the in universe work of art <em>Tears of Fire</em>).</p>
<p>Within the disciplines of metaphsyics and epistemology, there are questions about the nature of internal mental states. We should first recognize that these are distinct from physical brain states. While it might be appropriate to correlate brain states with mental ones, within the domain of philosophy, we still treat the two as distinct from one another.</p>

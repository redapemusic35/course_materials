# David Lewis's Truth in Fiction

RedApeMusic's current habitation is in New Babbage on Micro Tech. He possesses a number of personal items including a Cutter and an Aurora. The Cutter he upgraded to from a Drake Dragon Fly black which he never used. He recently attended a three-hour course on dog fighting with a highly experienced and accomplished dog fighter. During the course, he learned that the forward velocity of a projectile is about a 2 to 1 ratio with the velocity of an intended target (someone help me out here).

However, he isn't a family man (or he is and spends time on deployment?). It isn't clear whether this was ever a missed opportunity or not. He has a number of armored items as well as civies that he changes in and out of at various times.

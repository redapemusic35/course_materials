\chapter{Syllogisms}

My saucepans are the only things I have that are made of tin. \\
I find all your presents very useful. \\
None of my saucepans are of the slightest use. \\

No potatoes of mine, that are new, have been boiled. \\
All my potatoes in this dish are fit to eat. \\
No unboiled potatoes of mine are fit to eat. \\

No one takes in the Times, unless he is well educated. \\
No hedgehogs can read. \\
Those who cannot read are not well educated.

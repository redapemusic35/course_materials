% Acknowledgment section is REQUIRED.
\begin{thesisacknowledgments}
Use the \emph{required} acknowledgments section to thank people who have helped you complete your thesis, either professionally (e.g., colleagues and advisors) or personally (family and friends).  If your work was supported by a fellowship or a grant to your advisor, you should also acknowledge that support here, in a form something like the following:

This work was supported by NSF award ABC-1234567.
\end{thesisacknowledgments}

%% Uncomment next section and provide text to generate an optional dedication page.

% Abstract section is REQUIRED.
%
% Previously, the Library's guidance was that this abstract should be limited to 350 words to fit within limits imposed by various abstract collection services. It's not clear if this limit still exists.
\begin{thesisabstract}
The thesis abstract gives a brief overview of your work. The abstract will be indexed by various bibliographic services, so make sure that it is likely to rank highly in searches related to your work. It's likely that many more people will read your abstract, as a search result, than will read the actual thesis. Historically, there was a strict limit of 350 words for dissertation abstracts, which was imposed by the bibliographic services. It's not clear if this limit still exists, but it is probably longer than you actually want for your abstract.  This abstract has been padded out to about 250 words.

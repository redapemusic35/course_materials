The introduction should not include subheadings. Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted. "],["sec2.html", "2 Results", " 2 Results Sample body text. Sample body text. Sample body text. Sample body text.

"],["sec4.html", "4 Equations", " 4 Equations Equations in  can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (“display equations”). For inline equations use the $...$ commands. E.g.: The equation \\(H\\psi = E \\psi\\) is written via the command $H \\psi = E \\psi$. For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers) one can use the equation or align environments: \\[\\begin{equation} \\|\\tilde{X}(k)\\|^2 \\leq\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{p}\\left\\|\\tilde{Y}_i(k)\\right\\|^2+\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|\\tilde{Z}_j(k)\\right\\|^2 }{p+q}.\\label{eq1} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\[\\begin{align} D_\\mu &amp;= \\partial_\\mu - ig \\frac{\\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\\mu \\nonumber \\\\ F^a_{\\mu\\nu} &amp;= \\partial_\\mu A^a_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A^a_\\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\\mu A^a_\\nu \\label{eq2} \\end{align}\\] Notice the use of \\nonumber in the align environment at the end of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on lines where no equation numbers are required. The \\label{} command should only be used at the last line of an align environment where \\nonumber is not used. \\[\\begin{equation} Y_\\infty = \\left( \\frac{m}{\\textrm{GeV}} \\right)^{-3} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{3 \\ln(m/\\textrm{GeV})}{15} + \\frac{\\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \\right] \\end{equation}\\] The class file also supports the use of \\mathbb{}, \\mathscr{} and \\mathcal{} commands. As such \\mathbb{R}, \\mathscr{R} and \\mathcal{R} produces \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathscr{R}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) respectively (refer Subsubsection ). "],["sec5.html", "5 Tables", " 5 Tables Tables can be inserted via the normal knitr::kable() function or other table-generating packages. Tables can also be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put footnotes inside tables you should use \\footnotetext[]{...} tag. The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~ and ). For the corresponding footnotemark use \\footnotemark[...] The input format for the above table is as follows: \\begin{table}[&lt;placement-specifier&gt;] \\caption{&lt;table-caption&gt;}\\label{&lt;table-label&gt;}% \\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}} \\toprule Column 1 &amp; Column 2 &amp; Column 3 &amp; Column 4\\\\ \\midrule row 1 &amp; data 1 &amp; data 2 &amp; data 3 \\\\ row 2 &amp; data 4 &amp; data 5\\footnotemark[1] &amp; data 6 \\\\ row 3 &amp; data 7 &amp; data 8 &amp; data 9\\footnotemark[2]\\\\ \\botrule \\end{tabular} \\footnotetext{Source: This is an example of table footnote.

For this, you need to use \\begin{table*} ... \\end{table*} instead of \\begin{table} ... \\end{table} environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \\begin{sidewaystable} ... \\end{sidewaystable} instead of \\begin{table*} ... \\end{table*} environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \\begin{sidewaystable*} ... \\end{sidewaystable*}.

Use the dev knitr option to use the approrpate format. This is one of the major difference between  and PDFLaTeX. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for  and PDFLaTeX can be generalized. The package used to insert images in LaTeX/PDFLaTeX is the graphicx package.

Other environments such as equation and align can be labelled via the \\label{#label} command inside or just below the \\caption{} command. You can then use the label for cross-reference. As an example, consider the chunk label declared for Figure  which is fig1. To cross-reference it, use the command Figure \\ref{fig:fig1}, for which it comes up as “Figure ”. To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm  is \\label{algln2}. To cross-reference it, use the command \\ref{algln2} for which it comes up as line  of Algorithm . 8.1 Details on reference citations For citations of references, use Campbell and Gear (1995) or (Slifka and Whitton 2000).

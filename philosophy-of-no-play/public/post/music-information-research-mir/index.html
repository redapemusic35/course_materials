<p>What is computational music genre recognition, and what would recommendation systems look like if designed by the music listening public? In terms of the study of <em>music information research</em>, some questions typically include questions about the ontology of music itself, what determines genre, distribution, etc. Standard ways of answering these questions include counting the rythmic features, comparing and contrasting them with one another. One could also compare the complexity or simplicity of music, or the music notation. To these traditional methods of determining what the normative features for music are, Born suggests a different notion of ontology as a method of study. For these, she suggests information that the music represents. For instance, music can represent, or possess features central to a given culture, such as those that contribute to human flourishing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In this light, the article asks what computational music genre recognition or recommendation would look like if, under public-cultural or non-profit imperatives, the incentives driving them aimed to optimise imaginative self- or group development, pursuing not a logic of ‘similarity’ but diversity, or took human musical flourishing as their goals.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 193</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=1&amp;annotation=QE2IXH4H">pdf</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some likely possibilities include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it would optimize the imaginative self development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or group development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would be diverse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and contribute to human wellbeing</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>“One theme is interdisciplinarity: how MIR would gain from closer dialogues with contemporary musicology, music anthropology and sociology. The article also considers how the ‘refresh’ might address MIR’s pursuit of research oriented to technological innovation, often linked to the drive for economic growth; concerns about sustainable economies, it argues, suggest the need for other values to guide future science and engineering.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 193</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=1&amp;annotation=NTZZD4C3">pdf</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, it would be interdisciplinary with musicology, music anthropology and sociology.</p>
<p>Asking, what are the</p>
<p>“cultural backgrounds’ characterizing MIR as a field.1” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 193</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=1&amp;annotation=ZSUF5SDB">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>Who are the members of the MIR community? To determine this, the Born proposes that there are four dimensions of diversity with questions about the community’s members being the first consideration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first is the one just referred to: who gets to be a member of ISMIR, which is to say, what is the demographic makeup of MIR as a profession?” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 195</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=3&amp;annotation=MNERX5FD">pdf</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second dimension is perhaps more sensitive than the author suggests. A further question is who gets to decide and what are the normative factors of such a decision?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The second dimension of diversity is to do with whose music and which music, among the vast ocean of sounds in the world, gets to be the focus of MIR’s influential scientific practices.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 195</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=3&amp;annotation=KEDLH9NH">pdf</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third questions involves the foundational premises of the field. Previously these were proposed to be questions merely of the technical</p>
<p>“The third aspect of diversity is directly implicated in the previous point: it concerns the foundational epistemological and ontological premises that currently undergird MIR as a field.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=G8UKKRRG">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“which masters or mistresses does MIR serve – the profit-seeking imperatives of commercial music tech corporations and online music services, entangled as they are in the recorded music industries” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=DAF5FRW3">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“And which mistresses should MIR serve in order to diversify its goals, partners and worldly effects?” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=LXAGJHWS">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“As the STS scholar Madeleine Akrich has argued, design is a key stage in which engineers ‘script’ envisaged uses into their technologies, in this way ‘configuring’ potential user identities and preferring certain patterns of use (Akrich, 1992).” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=H8NFJAJL">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“In suggesting that social relations and imaginaries are scripted into technological design, I am not making an essentialist point that gender identities always determine design; nor do I imply that actual users are entirely constrained to follow the scripts inscribed in the technologies.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=ZT8VGMYL">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“The underlying point is that scientific and engineering fields like those of MIR, which are all too easy to envision as spaces isolated from wider social forces, are in fact consequential sites in which these social forces are played out, and therefore ripe for a politics of diversity” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 196</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=4&amp;annotation=TUV7US7J">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“The second dimension of diversity is the question of whose music and which music become the focus of MIR’s scientific practices and their influential applications, for example in recommendation systems.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 197</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=5&amp;annotation=5BGMZHSY">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“There is, in other words, surely a risk of teleology in beginning with existing tools derived from the analysis of Western pop and seeing if they ‘work’ for some fragmentary, decontextualised trait extracted from the total socio-musical existence of Central African music.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 197</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=5&amp;annotation=C5YS8HSG">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“Although an auto-critique of the elevation of Western pop music as a universal model for all music is beginning to develop within MIR, then, it seems that the profound challenges posed by ‘other’ musics have not yet been sufficiently registered and worked through (Born and Hesmondhalgh, 2000).” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 198</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=6&amp;annotation=PKYHKCBA">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“One of the most renowed singers in the local community was the blind, elderly woman folk singer Gavara-devi Gosayi. In this film clip, shot by Deo in 2012, Gosayi was performing live at an annual festival called the Kabir Yatra.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 198</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=6&amp;annotation=5F7JWFA3">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“. The second clip, in contrast, shows Gosayi singing, accompanied by her own harmonium playing as well as two young male percussionists, inside a local recording studio where she was being recorded by Lokayan activists.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 198</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=6&amp;annotation=AX9E7VL3">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“local followers of Kabir. What comes across is how social inequalities of gender, caste and age permeate the recording session, shaping the sociality of the studio and its musical results.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 198</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=6&amp;annotation=BWGYZNDA">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“cultural sensitivity or even turning this music into a commodity.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=GXFBXWU9">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“It was, rather, that the very disembedding of this music from its live, local communities of practice by recording perpetrated a form of ontological violence, an ontological violence fuelled by the social, cultural and economic distance between local musicians – whose music is profoundly embedded in communal socialities and religious cosmologies – and development-aid-funded activists, and a violence that those who value and respect Gosayi, her music and her community must call out” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=ITT8MWV7">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“So the challenge posed to MIR by non-Western musics is not just to get the rhythmic or timbral analysis right, or to take the cues about musical difference from such musics and not impose inappropriate musical values, qualities and systems on them.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=ADR2YJSP">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“It is also to recognize that all musics – and most spectacularly those non-Western musics that have as yet resisted incorporation into the global archives of digitized recorded music – have an ontology, that those ontologies are plural and often deeply social as well as religious or cosmological (Bohlman, 1999; Born, 2013; Sykes, 2019), and that they may be antithetical to, or profoundly different from, the universalised music ontologies assumed by MIR and companion disciplines.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=NIM93GZ5">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“it concerns certain epistemological and ontological assumptions underpinning MIR as a field, which turn on the way that ontology is understood.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=RJ22SJF8">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“These questions arise from the very different approaches to analysing ontologies of music that characterise MIR, on the one hand, and contemporary musicology and ethnomusicology, on the other.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=CGUH88XZ">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“Similarly, for music informatician Darrel Conklin, applying this approach to a corpus of Basque folk songs, ‘an ontology is an encoding of concepts and their relations in a domain of knowledge’ (Conklin, 2013: 162).” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=PR5P6TYU">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“and that such representations capture the most salient aesthetic and ontological features of all musics.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=AGADKCIJ">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“For the music of Gavara-devi Gosayi and her community is immanently bound to live performance, to the socialities engendered in such performance situations, and to the cosmologies and poetry associated with a 15th century poet-saint as they are infused with a politics of resistance to caste oppression.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=FIHB76UI">pdf</a>)</p>
<p>“Turning this around, the question arises for the MIR community: if more musical diversity is sought, and if respecting the musical ontologies of the source communities is ethically responsible and aesthetically desirable, then what kind of knowledge practices might support MIR to analyse and model these kinds of musical cultures ‘as a whole’ (Serra, 2017: 1), or at least more adequately and less reductively?” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=DAQTSIIB">pdf</a>)</p>

<p>“To tackle this challenge would mean prizing open those base epistemological and ontological premises of MIR through close dialogue with those music scholars and disciplines whose specialism is the analysis of music’s cultural, social and material as well as sonic dimensions: that is, music anthropologists and sociologists.” (<a href="zotero://select/groups/2202160/items/5J2HRKFE">Born, 2020, p. 199</a>) (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/groups/2202160/items/6R7H49EX?page=7&amp;annotation=UZAK3N99">pdf</a>)</p>

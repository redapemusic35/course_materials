This is how we understand their motives, actions, and feelings [54]. Our practice of imagining the emotions and perspectives of other people is a central feature of human social life [56]. Perspective is our ability to imagine the point of view of another. By perspective we plan our actions and predict the actions of others. It is possible that we misimagine others however. We might imagine a loved one to be in distress even though they are not. Imagined fictional personalities are not an illusion. The characters themselves have real motives and actions. However, they can be an invitation to isslusion by allowing us to connect possible characters, personalities with possible motives and actions. “We are rarely aware of the limits of our imaginative grasp of one another in everyday live, and of how often we do not manage to imagine at all” [88]. Sometimes we are unable to predict the motivations and emotions of others. This is because of an asymmetry between actions with good outcomes and others with not so good outcomes. “The asymmetry is that admiration often blocks the desire to understand, while frustration or disapporval often prompts it, so that we are more aware of the difficulties in imagining uncooperative people” [91]. While we might understand why someone commits an awful act, we cannot understand how they are able to commit the awful action. This is because we “raise the stakes for explanation of evil actions” [94]. These sorts of actions require a more thorough explanation. Yet, these do not have a special motive, but it seems that Morton attributes these to a weakness of will. I am not convinced. Distinctions between empathy and sympathy may either be: emotional resonance - feeling what another feels (e.g., Peter Goldie 2004 “On Personality,” or 2011 “Anti-empathy”) emotional appropriateness — having a suitable reaction to another person’s situation emotional identification — having an emotion that makes you take their purposes to your heart and their troubles as your concern. When we attempt to understand, by imagining, someone else’s experiences and motivations, we have to “manage a tradeoff between completeness and accuracy” [109].

Can look at Elaine Fox (2008) “Emotion Science.” Discusses what scientists have learned about the emotions. Copp (2007) talks about morality in terms of emotions, beliefs and rules. Part 1:\nAll emotion involves imagination [1]. Imagination involves representing something to ourselves [8]. Because of imagination, we can “see” anything. Our emotions inspire us to search for actions that will address particular problems which we face. But we must make sure to distinguish between emotion and mood. e.g., emotions have objects whereas moods do not. Our emotions put pressures on our thoughts, desires, conjectures, fantasies, and perceptions. This pressure in turn is interpreted as a feeling. There are different categories of emotion understood as a four way distinction between emotion and mood. A way to understand this, is by understanding our emotions as a two-way cross-cutting distinction between passions and sentiments and another between moods and emotions [48]. mood and passion mood and sentiment emotion and passion emotion and sentiment "},"title":"Imagining Emotion"},"/2024/06/11/imagining-moral-emotions/":{"data":{"":" The general point is that we want to know when to hope that someone is regretful (perhaps for a mistake) or contemptuous (perhaps towards a fake), and when to fear that they may be resentful (perhaps that one has told an inconvenient truth) or grateful (perhaps because someone has done their job more thoroughly than required). And we do not want these conclusions to just depend on what is conventionally or intuitively considered good or moral.\nOur moral terms are motivated by our emotions. [Jesse Prinz, the emotional contruction of morals; Jonathan Haidt, “The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail: A social intuitiounist approach to moral judgment.” Although the way our emotions make us feel about a situation may be inappropriate, or misguided, we cannot retract the fact that our emotional response was thus. However, we can have other emotions regarding our initial emotional response which are a kind of retraction. There are some emotions which allow us multiple perspectives. For instance, we might imagine a subjective perspective, say you feel the pain your friend might have experienced when his girlfriend broke up with him, but you might also have access to a more objective emotion wherein you feel the hurt caused by your friend when he cheated on his girlfriend. “ ‘Objective’ here means, I think, not that it is some sort of physical fact, but that a person who saw the situation objectively — that is, not through one’s own eyes — would react that way” [128]. Moral emotions, given these multiple perspectives then, are imagined “complex emotions built out of two others. . . ” [131]. “The first is an attitude to a real or imagined occupant of a point of view. . . . The second is an attitude from this point of view towards an act or pattern of action” [131]. There is a great diversity and variety of moral emotions. These can correspond with imagined points of view. Further, “moral emotions, in all their discord and variety, are generated by hanging simple emotions towards people and situations along branching points of view” [139], a point of view which can vary. This might account for the problematic effects that empathy can sometimes manifest in our behaviors to strangers. Yet, having two perspectives which are oppossing [subjective and objective (in part)] to one another, will allow us to act as “impartial observers distant from the immediate situation. And in this direction we come eventually to a completely detached but rather inscrutable point of view valuing only humanity, justice, welfare” [139]. Morton suggests that this process is similar to that expressed by Lawrence Kohlberg in his “stages of moral development.” However, it is not clear whether this is something that occurs when a child matures through the stages of development from child to adult, or is it something relegated only to a kind of moral development which I think can come about later in life also. However, this varied perspective can also to not discount immediately our emotional responses to situations. For instance, we might have an emotional experience because someone mentioned a crude remark. We might initially think that we are over reacting, but as we continue to think about it and attempt to imagine scenarios wherein the remark was benign, it appears to us that there was in fact no justifcation for the remark and therefore our initial emotional response is appropriate. Moral Emotions which do not necessarily enable moral learning, or possibly prevent it: smugness, hypocracy, etc. For instance, “[w]hen you are smug, you feel approval from some respected source, directed at your general character and actions” [150]. This allows three things: An attitude to others wherein you hold some advantage over them. You become satisfied in your current state and therefore do not need change of any kind. 1 and 2 lead to complacency wherein you become comfortable in maintaining ideas of superiority over others; even if these ideas are not warranted. "},"title":"Imagining Moral Emotions"},"/2024/06/11/motivating-apt-emotions/":{"data":{"":"How do we come to have apt emotional expressions? On the one hand, it might be fruitless to criticize another for the lack of an emotion they are not able to produce.\nYou can’t just decide to be happy, or to have some chosen belief. And if you are experiencing self-punishing remorse when regret would make more sense, it is not enough to simply tell yourself so. p. 198\nBut how true is this? What power do we have over our emotions? Some possibilities include the following:\nchange our states of mind attend selectively to evidence choose who to associate with In other words,\nwe should not conclude that we have no power over what we feel.\nHere is the main idea of this book and how this final part will develop it. We can have an enormours range of emtions, in part because our flexible imaginations allow us emotions structured around multiple points of view. So it is a real question which emotions are best for us, and when. And since emotions with multiple points of view are central to moral life, the question allows us to wonder which moral attitudes are harmful, perverse, or counterproductive. One way of making the question manageable is to consider families of moral emotions—one example consists of the much discussed cousins regret, remorse, guilt, shame, and embarrassment — and the ways in which we can slide into one of them when another would make more sense. [157] If we have a concept of a particular emotion, we are then better able to experience that emotion. From families of emotions, we can choose which ones we ought to encourage one another to feel and determine which ones are obstacles to our moral lives [158].\nDifferent emotions resemble one another. Some emotions resemble others in the way they subjectively feel whereas others resemble one another in regards to the way that motivate an agent to think or act. The important resemblances are those that relate to our moral lives, for instance shame and disapproval. Here, imagination becomes relevant because we might ask whether a particular emotion was appropriate, e.g., disapproval and anger, in a particular situation. One family of emotions includes sharme, regret, embarrassment and remorse. Embarrasment and regret are the outliers, for instance, embarrassment is more shallow than shame or remorse. We might see shame on one end and remorse on the other. For instance, shame occurs when we “we apprehend a trait as an attribute of ourselves which we take to exemplify the polar opposite of a self-relevant value’.” “In other words, the person experiencing shame feels that she is inadequate in some way that is important, as revealed by some action” [160]. Embarrassment however, is different from shame in that it includes a recognition of the ridicoulusness of your own actions. Further however, this recognition may either be followed by your own amusement or your own disgust [161]. Shame-like emotions are similar to someone staringt malevolently at you [164] while regret-like emotions result, sometimes, from events over which you had no control and which you likely had no other real options. Remorse, unlike regret, can continue to feel almost indefinitely. Moral emotions are emotions of appeal, e.g., some emotions like regret or remorse may feel like an appeal from someone affected by some past action taken by us. But each moral emotion involve varying potential perspectives of our own actions, or actions taken by others but through our own point of view. However, there are some emotions which may be hard to hard to fit between the emotion and either the target of that emotion, an attitude to a point of view inferred by that emotion etc [181—182]. There are two different emotions which can be expressed in pride. One set might be contrasted against humility while the other can be contrasted with shame. As mentioned, there is a danger that pride can result in smugness which hinders moral development rather then its consequent; self-respect. Absurdity can be contrasted with despair. Given the imagination and our moral emotions, we may imagine a situation we find ourselves in from the perspective of others, and through this realize how absurd our situation is. On the other hand, despair “recognizes the futility of hope” [165]. We might imagine a situation we find ourselves in, however, in imagining, we recognize that our situation really is hopeless. While we cannot decide to feel differently than we do at any given moment, this does not mean that we do not have control over our emotions. “I will give three reasons why having the concept of a particular moral emotion — having it in a full way by having a word for it, being able to describe cases where people experience it, and being able to imagine having it — makes it easier to enter into the emotion” [199]. “If we have a name for a pattern of behaviour, then we are more likely to notice it when it occurs, and having noticed it, we are in a better position to imagine being in a state that would lead to it, and being able to imagine it, we are nearer to being able to enter into it” [199]. This is important because as I have shown before, Morton believes that emotions correspond with various pressures. Further, pressures can be seen as a kind of motivation, so some emotion might be important to have because it will pressure a moral agent to perform certain actions in certain situations. “So with moral emotions we have a fixed frame of points of view, which needs just to have different basic emotions attached to it” [200]. “The third reason is the vividness and emotional resonance of our imagination of people” [200]. “. . . The concept of the emotion tells one what personalities to imagine, in which roles in the perspective structure of the emotion” [200]. Doing this is a way of “making moral emotions available, by giving them attention, grasping their perspective structure, and imagining occupants of their points of view” [201]. Ultimately, moral imagining is a virtue we ought to cultivate [206].

This may become necessary when attempting to determine how to reconcile our past, current or future behaviors. A way to do so is by determining who we take ourselves to be and calculating what kinds of behaviors are a likely consequence. A popular example is that of someone who seems to remember leading soldiers into battle at Waterloo. But lets further imagine that they were born in 1980 rather than 1780. This is an extreme case however, but there is a more mundane case that can reflect the concern we associate with identity claims.\nLets imagine that for whatever reason, I seem to remember putting my keys on the kitchen counter. However, this memory may conflict with who I believe myself to be. As I have always thought of myself as the kind of self who lives an orderly and regimented life. This means that I keep an orderly home, always placing my items in the places that I designate for them. The kitchen counter is not the kind of place that I have designated for my keys and as such, I cannot reconcile this memory (putting my keys on the kitchen counter) with the kind of self that I take myself to be.\nOn a bodily criterion, identity is established if and only if the body of A is continuous with the body of B. The question being whether my body is the same body as the self that places their keys on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway. If it is, then we have established identity.\nHowever, there are various views that understand the psychological account of continuity as better expressing what we mean by identity. For instance, how do we explain phrases such as it is hard for me to reconcile the person I was with who I am. Or consider questions of legal punishment. We might think a particular inmate deserves clemency because they are no longer the person who committed a given crime. If bodily criterion is the only acceptable criterion for identity, then how do we explain rehabilitation or salvation?\nWhether or not I identify with the sort of personality that places their keys un-reflectively on the kitchen counter rather than the key hook in the entryway is another way of understanding why the psychological criterion is important.

I am interested more broadly in artifacts of culture however and their uses as moral testimony. Artifacts of culture I understand as sources of testimony which a culture uses to communicate various values to members on the inside and outside of that culture.\nIn the following are various reflections on the question regarding play’s ability to communicate and negotiate various values to the members of a culture.","documentation#Documentation":"For more information on how to build a similar site, visit Hextra.

I always thought that it was a cool concept and unlike any game I had heard of or played. I should inform the viewer however that I am not truly a gamer. What I mean by this statement, is that you, as my audience should take my claim: “unlike any game I have heard of or played” with a grain of salt. I do not have much experience. In fact, though other members of my family, namely from a previous generation (and namely exactly one) were quite early adopters of “gaming culture”, my most immediate family members were quite sceptical of anything having to do with the nature of play and make-believe. Video games, comic books, Dungeons and dragons, etc.\nRegardless of all that however, here we are. Where are we you might ask? In a simulated environment that some call a scam and others call the most ambitious project to date. Is Star Citizen a scam or a game? I personally hope that it isn’t either. What do you call a virtual environment with numerous mini games inside of it? Do games contain games? What is a game and are there normative criteria defining what counts as a game? How many nested goals should a game contain? Eve Online, another simulated environment replete with mini games could contain an answer for us. While some may be caught up in buying and selling, trading and manufacturing, others could very well get lost in the enumerable systems containing thousands of potential victims to their genocidal ideations.\nGames are a kind of artifact in this sense, at least they might be and that’s what we are here to figure out. What better place to start than in the UAE universe, more specifically, the Stanton system. Each week (Ambitious, I know. But a guy can dream can’t he?) I will upload a reading to the associated “course” website. These will be various readings on game theory, design, literary theory, cultural studies, etc, all having to do with video games. At least that is how we will apply these readings. Star Citizen will be the context.\nOn the left of this page is a list of links. Look for one that sounds interesting to you, click on it and give it a pick. You could also continue with this one which is merely some notes on readings in the philosophy of play genre. This is otherwise known, or is a grounding for the philosophy of videogames literature. Except I will spend most of the time talking about Star Citizen which is either a scam, a simulator, or the best most ambitious videogame to date. My kids hate it but they can’t look away when I play it. I consider this a win.\nMany of the material here are incomplete ramblings. Hopefully they are complete enough to transmit some kind of meaning regardless of how opaque. The intent is to be able to communicate something that motivates conversation. Oh yeah, and you can leave comments below each. Just please don’t cuss me out because my kids may be reading over my shoulder.\n“What are we doing when we play a game?” (Nguyen, 2017, p. 1) (pdf)"},"title":"A Philosophy of Star Citizen"},"/post/aesthetics-of-identity/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Introduction In his Apt Imaginings, John Gilmore defends an account where the moral value of a work of art is grounded in the purpose and function that it was created to realize.\nI suggest that we can discover an internal relation between the artistic and moral value of a work in the relation between, broadly speaking, the moral vision of a wwork of art and the point, purpose, or function it was created to realize.\nConsidering whether some works of art have moral flaws or not, Gilmore argues that such defects are instantiated by the failure of the artist to accurately represent some content. But this says nothing about works of art that do not intend to represent moral content, but rather work towards realizing some divergent end, say entertainment, or financial capital through popularity and sales.\nThus, there are some kinds of reasons that justify an emotion felt toward a state of affairs represented in a fiction or imagining that would not justify that emotion when felt toward an analogous state of affairs in the real world.\nAs such, it is not clear how to criticize such works of art."},"title":"Aesthetics of Identity"},"/post/mortons-emotion-and-imagination/":{"data":{"":"What is the link between emotion and imagination? This page should have its own folder like some of the other reflections. It will eventually. I am currently in the process of moving many of my notes from an older repository to this one.\nAdam Morton argues that through the use of imagination, we have the capacity to imagine another’s moral emotions by imagining their imaginings.\nImagining the other person’s emotion here means imagining their imagination . . .. p. 206\nIn order to avoid what Morton calls moral smugness, a vice that undermines second-personal knowledge, we must practice what he calls emotional unbundling. It is a virtue that requires that we take motives from which our own emotions are constructed and attribute them as much as it is possible to someone else’s.\nA person acts, moved by shame, approval, condemnation, or some other moral emotion. Another person tries to understand, and perhaps to anticipate the next action. But she knows that if she were acting from shame, condemnation, or approval, she would do something very different. Perhaps what he calls shame is leading him to public confession rather than wanting to hide; perhaps what he calls condemnation is leading him to teasing rather than attack. One possibility the second person must face is that his shame, or condemnation, is not hers. Perhaps they are different emotions with some family resemblance. Part of the evidence that a similar but different emotion was at work could be that the second person managed to imagine such an emotion and it fitted. But to get this evidence, she would have to be able to do the imagining. p. 206"},"title":"Mortons Emotion and Imagination"},"/post/on-narrative/":{"data":{"":"Readings on Identity and Narrative. These will include literature on the philosophy and the psychology of narrative identity."},"title":"On Narrative"},"/post/semantic-web-and-the-virtues-of-cooperation/":{"data":{"":"As noted in emerging work on country music, there is a reason to think that personal identity is socially constructed. Authors have argued that the narrative implicit in country music’s aesthetic is used to construct the identity of the modern American Anglo Saxon man [@mann08; @shus99; @meis22a; @gros02; @haye10; @holl19; @hugh15; @wats20b]. Critical race theorists also ask similar questions regarding the social construction of the identities of racial minorities. Agency is a central concern on both accounts. Philosophical work on narrative and identity offers a way of understanding social influence on personal identity. In some philosophical and psychological literature, agency is rooted in one’s emotional experiences upon a retelling of their life story [@alts21; @shec90; @vell05; @kors96]. More specifically, a narrative can motivate various feelings, for instance of regret [@gold09], or pride, towards actions that one did or did not do. I consider questions of agency in regards to various relational virtues.\nOne’s emotional dispositions can effectively portray the endorsement or rejection of one’s past behavior or behaviors and subsequently, an agent’s inter-relational values. For my purposes here, there are three kinds of narratives that contribute to a narrative account of agency. They include autobiographical narratives [@mcad13; @mcad14; @pasu16]. These narratives are internalized reconstructions of events. They include an emotional evaluation of such events and taken as a whole, are central to one’s understanding of who they are. It has been argued that those which are biographical and autobiographical are important for social identities and that social identity is important for moral and relational responsibility [@mcle15; @fivu04; @fivu10]. As a case in point, we can imagine one’s sense of regret or lack thereof for a falling out between best friends, or a sense of self-blame, for the awkward way in which a dinner guest leaves their house. More importantly, we might ask how such regret motivates future behavior [Especially @gold09].\nAgency too then is an important concern in questions of personhood in this regard. We can ask what are the implications of one’s personhood when person A’s agency, rather than B’s is cited as an explanation of B’s circumstances regarding their circumstances, relational and otherwise. Of course, if we only understand identity as a progression of psychological states over time, then these differences are not as significant. Therefore such distinctions would not be as important for non-personal conceptions of identity [See @parf87; and @alts21]. But if we think that narrative and agency are important, or important sources for one’s own sense of identity, e.g. autobiographical vs biographical narrative, then emotional dispositions and their social constraints are central to human behavior. As such, narratives may be central to moral and interpersonal or inter-relational responsibility. Importantly, this is because they are central to one’s past emotional dispositions and can effectively endorse pro or anti-social behaviors.\nHowever, the sources of narrative is unclear. In regards to the relationship between narrative and identity, some are said to be biographical (personal) while others autobiographical (social) [@mcle15b]. Therefore, correspondingly, we might think that there is a missed opportunity in the existing philosophical literature on race to remark on the importance of relational agency as inferred by attributed social identities and how individuals navigate these. One area in the social construction of race where there could be more discussion, are the various characterizations of racial minorities regarding interpersonal relationship constitutions as inferred by their social identities. What does the familial structure of the typical racial minority look like according to popular culture for instance? What emotions are central to the breakup of a relationship and what emotions are central to companionship?\nI consider extracted sentiment to understand represented relational term objects in popular art [@moha21]. This will enable us to visualize emotionally valenced relational content. By analyzing the sentiment content of music lyrics, I attempt to extract those phrases that artists attach the most sentient to. These include both negatively and positively valenced cultural ascriptions of the social values among members of various populations. I ask what contributions do these make in the construction of social identities. By determining the valence, emotions, and other affectual attributions from music lyrics, I suggest that a more comprehensive project in this area will go further towards determining the portrayed broader cultural attitudes about inter-relational dispositions of minority cultures.\nWhile there is significant criticism regarding insufficient representation in media publishing, there is not similar concern for expressions of pro vs anti-social emotion expression. Some have previously attempted to explain human agency as a central aspect of personal identity by narratives both autobiographical and biographical [@mcle15b; @book22a; @brun90; @alts21; @vell05a]. This project continues that work by asking what values are suggested through an analysis of sentiment in important cultural artifacts. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, I primarily focus on popular music. Here, constructions of social identity necessarily entail relational agency more broadly. I suggest that such a study will go towards revealing the importance of broader cultural ascriptions of the relationships that exist between members of a given culture."},"title":"Semantic Web and the Virtues of Cooperation"}}

<p>The moral foundations dictionary developed by Mark Alfano is a natural language process that is intended to detect foundational terms in moral cooperation. According to the ethical theory <em>morality as cooperation</em>, humans over time have faced a number of problems necessitating the need for cooperation. In response to these needs, we have developed various methods for cooperation that act as solutions to these problems. As the theory continues, across all societies, we can identity traits that evolved in humans in light of these needs. The forms these evolved characteristics take are cooperative behaviors that resemble: character traits, strategies, dispositions, behaviors, rules, norms, institutions, and technologies.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@curr16</span> has argued there are seven:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>family values</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Kin selection explains why we love and care for our families, why parents feel a duty of care to their offspring, why we feel a special obligation to help our extended families, and why we abhor incest (Hamilton, 1964; Lieberman, Tooby, &amp; Cosmides, 2003).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>group loyalty</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Mutualism explains why we coordinate our activities to pursue projects of mutual interest, why we form groups, clubs, and coalitions (there is strength and safety in numbers), why we value these groups, their members, and our membership in them, why we adopt local norms and conventions, why we feel a special obligation to come to the aid of group members, and why we value loyalty, unity and solidarity (Lewis, 1969; Royce, 1908).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>reciprocity</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Social exchange explains why we seek opportunities for mutually-beneficial trade, and why we feel we ought to trust others, return favours (positive reciprocity), keep promises, pay debts, fulfil contracts, be grateful for favours received, feel guilty for favours not returned, avenge injuries (negative reciprocity), punish cheats, apologise for causing injuries, and forgive those who apologise (Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2005;Trivers, 1971).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>heroism</li>
<li>defense</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflict resolution explains why we minimise the mutual costs of disputes by engaging in ritual contests: why we proudly display cues of power and high status (‘excellences’, including bravery and generosity); and, when bested, why we express humility, and respect, defer, and submit to our superiors (Curry, 2007; Sznycer et al., 2017).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>fairness</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes over divisible resources by dividing or sharing them (often resulting in equal shares), and hence why we feel an obligation to negotiate, seek a compromise, and be fair (Messick, 1993; Skyrms, 1996).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>property rights</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Conflict resolution also explains why we resolve disputes by recognising prior possession, hence why we feel we ought to respect others’ property and territory, and refrain from theft (Gintis, 2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The morality as cooperation view predicts that there will be the same number of types of morality as there are of cooperation (Curry et al, 2019b). They test this hypothesis using a content analysis of 600 ethnographic accounts of 60 societies chosen at random from the electronic Human Relations Area Files (<em>eHRAF</em>). Alfano predicts that they can use natural language processing, more specifically the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count method developed by <span class="citation">@penn2015 [Also see @penn2011]</span> to test this hypothesis rather than the hand code holographic method (Otterbein 1978; Ember and Ember 2009) used by Curry <em>et al</em>. LIWC combs through a text and counts the number of words belonging to a given category. For instance, LIWC has been used to count the number of first person pronouns, psychological processes such as positive and negative emotions, and discreet emotions. LIWC relies on a given dictionary provided by the user which instructs what kinds of words to be counted.</p>
<p>Moral corpora is typically used by LIWC users to count moral terms using the <em>Moral Foundations Dictionary</em> [MFD], for instance Hoover et all use MFD to comb tweets for 5 domains and Padfield and Buchanan (2020) use MFD to characterize the moral lean of US news organizations. However, MFD is limited in a number of ways, not having foundations for family values, reciprocity, heroism, or property rights. In addition, there are interrater reliability issues. Given these issues, Alfano <em>et al</em> created the <em>Morality as Cooperation Dictionary</em> (MAC-D).</p>
<p>First they brainstormed words aligning with the seven basic moral principles hypothesized by Curry <em>et al</em>. These include loving your family, being loyal to your group, returning favours, exercising courage and generosity, showing deference to superiors, being fair in the distribution of resources, and respecting property. They next used the software program WordNet, which is a large English language lexical database. When given a word or phase, Wordnet generates synsets that can be used to search related terms according to a given category: synonyms, hyponyms, antonyms, hypernyms, etc. The resulting object, is a dictionary of terms belonging to each of the foundations.</p>

<h3>eHRAF</h3>
<p>eHRAF is an archive of thousands of full text ethnographies (Lagace 1979). Alfano <em>et al</em> also relied on these ethnographic accounts to test the terms in MAC-D. To do so, they extracted 331 paragraphs from eHRAF that were labeled as <em>ethics</em> resulting in 1,620,644 words from 9,653, paragraphs, from 1,389 documents, covering 256 societies, 8 cultural regions, following 9 subsistence strategies. They then used the MAC dictionary to calculate the percentage of words from each paragraph that was found in one or more of the seven foundation dictionaries.</p>

<h2>Building a Dataset</h2>
<p>I have several datasets comprised of Taylor Swift song lyrics. One of these is organized by year. A good question that is available to us using this dataset, is whether there are computationally significant differences between Swift’s earlier songs and more recent ones. One kind of difference we can discern could be whether her moral commitments changed according to the MAC-D. For instance, does she make more references to family values in her earlier stuff than she does her later.</p>

seen all through his lifetime Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights  Ive seen a million things Spoke a million words Now I only want to speak to you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  Still through the haze I can make out constellations Ill make one of you and me as we sit in the sand And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild Lets walk away the past through the smokey black nights  Ive played a thousand songs Sang a thousand words Now I only want to sing to you Waited on a wire Staring at the fire Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  Ive walked a thousand miles Smiled a thousand smiles Now I only smile when Im with you Waiting for the words Counting every bird Theres nothing Id rather do On the smokey black nights  So walk with me as the sweet wind dances Ill write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights  &#39;, &#39;Lucky You   Theres a little girl in this

Were Happy (Taylors Version)    We used to walk along the streets When the porch lights were shining bright Before I had somewhere to be Back when we had all night and we were happy I do recall a good while back,   we snuck into the circus You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it And we were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday And we were happy  We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water Thats sorta how I feel right now And goodbyes so much harder cause we were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday And we were happy We were happy  Oh, I hate those voices telling me Im not in love anymore But they dont give me choices and thats what these tears are for Cause we were happy We were happy  When it was good, baby, it was good, baby We showed em all up No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark Talking bout your daddys farm And you were gonna marry me And we were happy

about it Blue dress, angel face Looking in the mirror Shoes, purse, hair tied back And you should see her Shes got her magic Floating through the air  Peace, love One thing leads into another Dream big, aim small Man you got to love her Shes got her hopes up Got them up to there Wondering what to wear  Shes standing in her bedroom Hell be pulling up soon She thinks about it when she sees headlights Looking out the window Shes got her diary to show That shes been waiting for this all her life First date, cant wait Looking in the mirror Heart all wrapped up Wait until he sees her Hes looking right at her She thinks about it Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt Shoes, purse, hair tied back And you should see her Shes got her magic Floating through the air   The years went by The

##  [4] &quot;Im Only Me When Im With You   Friday night beneath the stars In a field behind your yard You and I are painting pictures in the sky And sometimes we dont say a thing Just listen to the crickets sing Everything I need is right here by my side  And I know everything about you I dont wanna live without you  Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me when Im with you  Just a small-town boy and girl Livin in a crazy world Tryna figure out what is and isnt true And I dont try to hide my tears My secrets or my deepest fears Through it all, nobody gets me like you do  And you know everything about me You say that you cant live without me  Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me when Im with you  When Im with anybody else Its so hard to be myself And only you can tell  That Im only up when youre not down Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground Its like no matter what I do Well you drive me crazy half the time The other half, Im only tryin to Let you know that what I feel is true And Im only me Who I wanna be Well Im only me when Im with you  With you Uh-huh-huh, yeah  &#39;, &#39;The Outside   I didnt know what I would find When I went looking for a reason, I know I didnt read between the lines And, baby, Ive got nowhere to go  I tried to take the road less traveled by But nothing seems to work the first few times Am I right?  So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this aint the best view On the outside looking in Ive been a lot of lonely places Ive never been on the outside  You saw me there, but never knew That I would give it all up to be A part of this, a part of you And now its all too late, so you see  You couldve helped if you had wanted to But no one notices until its too Late to do anything  How can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this aint the best view On the outside looking in Ive been a lot of lonely places Ive never been on the outside  Oh, yeah  How can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in And I can still see you, this aint the best view On the outside looking in Ive been a lot of lonely places Ive never been on the outside  Oh-oh Oh, oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh  &#39;, &#39;Our Song   I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down He says, Baby, is something wrong? I say, Nothin, I was just thinkin How we dont have a song And he says  Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tapping on your window When were on the phone and you talk real slow Cause its late and your mama dont know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have And when I got home, fore I said amen Askin God if he could play it again  I was walking up the front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong or been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, well on my way To my lovin bed I almost didnt notice all the roses And the note that said  Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tapping on your window When were on the phone and you talk real slow Cause its late and your mama dont know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: Man, I didnt kiss her, and I should have And when I got home, fore I said amen Askin God if he could play it again  Da-da-da-da  Ive heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for somethin to come along That was as good as our song  Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin out late, tappin on his window When were on the phone and he talks real slow Cause its late and his mama dont know Our song is the way he laughs The first date: Man, I didnt kiss him, and I should have And when I got home, fore I said amen Askin God if he could play it again  Play it again, oh, yeah Oh, oh, yeah  I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen and an old napkin And I wrote down our song  &#39;, &#39;Shouldve Said No   Its strange to think the songs we used to sing The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone Yesterday I found out about you Even now, just lookin at you feels wrong  You say that youd take it all back Given one chance It was a moment of weakness And you said yes  You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go You shouldve known that word Bout what you did with herd get back to me (Get back to me) And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind I shouldnt be asking myself why You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet You shouldve said no Baby, and you might still have me  You can see that Ive been cryin And baby, you know all the right things to say But do you honestly expect me to believe We could ever be the same?  You say that the past is the past You need one chance It was a moment of weakness And you said yes  You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go You shouldve known that word Bout what you did with herd get back to me (Get back to me) And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind I shouldnt be asking myself why You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet You shouldve said no Baby, and you might still have me Oh, oh  I cant resist Before you go, tell me this Was it worth it? Was she worth this? No, no No, no, no, no  You shouldve said no, you shouldve gone home You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go You shouldve known that word Bout what you did with herd get back to me (Get back to me) And I shouldve been there, in the back of your mind I shouldnt be asking myself why You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet You shouldve said no Baby, and you might still have me  &#39;, &#39;A Perfectly Good Heart   Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart?  Maybe I shouldve seen the signs Shouldve read the writing on the wall And realized by the distance in your eyes That I would be the one to fall  No matter what you say I still cant believe that you would walk away It dont make sense to me, but  Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart?  Its not unbroken anymore (Its not unbroken anymore) How do I get it back the way it was before?  Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break-- (Why) Would you wanna break it?  Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart?  Mmm-hmm  &#39;, &#39;Cold as You   You have a way of coming easily to me And when you take, you take the very best of me So I start a fight cause I need to feel something And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Just walk away, aint no use defending words that you will never say And now that Im sitting here thinking it through Ive never been anywhere cold as you  You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray And I stood there loving you and wished them all away And you come away with a great little story Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day So just walk away, aint no use defending words that you will never say And now that Im sitting here thinking it through Ive never been anywhere cold as you  You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died, died for you (Died for you)  Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Every smile you fake is so condescending Counting all the scars you made And now that Im sitting here thinking it through Ive never been anywhere cold as you Ooh  &#39;, &#39;Tied Together with a Smile   Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty Is the face in the mirror looking back at you You walk around here

undone, oh Oh, oh  Hold on, baby, youre losing it The waters high, youre jumping into it and letting go And no one knows That you cry but you dont tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And

said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, Thats a lie Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin stuck On backroads at night And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  September saw a month of tears And thankin God that you werent here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet And lookin back on all of that, its nice to believe  When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  And Im back for the first time since then Im standin on your street And theres a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that youll read is: When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song

pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my  Take me back to the house in the backyard tree Said youd beat me up, you were bigger than me You never did, you never did Take me back when our world was one block wide I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried Just two kids, you and I Oh my my my my  Well, I was sixteen when suddenly I wasnt that little girl you used to see But your eyes still shined like pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us They never believed wed really fall in love And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes And said oh my my my  Take me back to the creek beds we turned up Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me Take me back to the time we had our very first fight The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight You stayed outside till the morning light Oh my my my my  A few years had gone and come around We were sitting at our favorite spot in town And you looked at me, got down on one knee  Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle Our whole town came and our mamas cried You said

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shouldve known  Well, maybe its me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe its you and your sick need To give love and take it away And youll add my name to your long list of traitors Who dont understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said Run as fast as you can  Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Dont you think nineteens too young To be played by your dark, twisted games When I loved you so?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with?

You, with your switching sides And your wildfire lies and your humiliation You have pointed out my flaws again As if I dont already see them I walk with my head down, trying to block you out Cause Ill never impress you I just wanna feel okay again  I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now Cause you cant lead me down that road And you dont know what you dont know  Someday, Ill be living in a big ole city And all youre ever gonna be is mean Someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me And all youre ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?

You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine  Flash forward, and were taking on the world together And theres a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded You say well never make my parents mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes This is what I thought about:  Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine  And I remember that fight, : A.M As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye Cause thats all Ive ever known Then, you took me by surprise You said, Ill never leave you alone.  You said, I remember how we felt, sitting by the water And every time I look at you, its like the first time I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter She is the best thing thats ever been mine Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine  Yeah, yeah Do you believe it?

Oh, I thought youd be here by now Oh, oh Thought youd be here by now  &#39;, &#39;Innocent   I guess you really did it this time Left yourself in your war path Lost your balance on a tightrope Lost your mind trying to get it back  Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days? Always a bigger bed to crawl into Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything And everybody believed in you?

When everything out of reach Someone bigger brought down to you Wasnt it beautiful running wild til you fell asleep Before the monsters caught up to you?

Across the room, your silhouette Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks Like passing notes in secrecy And it was enchanting to meet you All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you  This night is sparkling, dont you let it go Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home Ill spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you  The lingering question kept me up  a.m., who do you love? I wonder til Im wide awake Now Im pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door Id open up and you would say Hey, it was enchanting to meet you All I know is I was enchanted to meet you  This night is sparkling, dont you let it go Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home Ill spend forever wondering if you knew This night is flawless, dont you let it go Im wonderstruck,  dancing around all alone Ill spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you   This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please dont be in love with someone else Please dont have somebody waiting on you Please dont be in love with someone else (Ooh) Please dont have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)  This night is sparkling, dont you let it go Im wonderstruck, blushing all the way home Ill spend forever wondering

I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind The time we stood with our shaking hands The crowds in stands went wild We were the kings and the queens And they read off our names The night you danced like you knew our lives Would never be the same You held your head like a hero On a history book page It was the end of a decade But the start of an age  Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered  I said, remember this feeling I passed the pictures around Of all the years that we stood there On the side-lines wishing for right now We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town And the cynics were outraged Screaming, This is absurd Cause for a moment, a band of thieves In ripped up jeans got to rule the world  Long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders Im not afraid Long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered  Hold on to spinning around Confetti falls to the ground May these memories break our fall  We have absolutely loved spending time in your town, and you have been so amazing to us I mean, you guys know every single word and youve danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage Thank you  Will you take a moment? And Promise me this That youll stand by me forever But if, God forbid, fate should step in And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day When they point to the pictures Please tell em my name Tell them how the crowds went wild Tell them how I hope they shine Long live the walls we crashed through I had the time of my life, with you  Long, long live the walls we crashed through All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming, long live all the magic we made And bring on all the pretenders Im not afraid Singing, long live all the mountains we moved I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you Long, long live that look on your face And bring on all the pretenders One day, we will be remembered &#39;, &#39;Ours (Live/)   Elevator buttons and morning air Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs If you were here, wed laugh about their vacant stares But right now, my time is theirs Seems like theres always someone who disapproves Theyll judge it like they know about me and you And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do The jurys out, but my choice is you  So dont you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the waters rough But this love is ours  You never know what people have up their sleeves Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles But I dont care, cause right now, youre mine  And youll say Dont you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the waters rough But this love is ours  And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong And Ill fight their doubt and give you faith With this song for you  Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos Will be ignored Cause my heart is yours  So dont you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard So Dont you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine But they cant take whats ours They cant take whats ours  The stakes are high, the waters rough But this love is ours &#39;, &#39;Dear John (Live/)   Long were the nights when My days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor wont fall through... again And my mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine You paint me a blue sky Then go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed your rules everyday Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why  Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda known  Well maybe its me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe its you and your sick need To give love and take it away And youll add my name to your long list of traitors Who dont understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said Run as fast as you can  Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Dont you think nineteens too young To be played by your dark, twisted games When I loved you so? I shoulda known  You are an expert at sorry And keeping the lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes Cause you burned them out But I took your matches Before fire could catch me So dont look now Im shining like fireworks Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  Dear John, I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home  I see it all now that youre gone Dont you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress Wrote you a song, you shoulda known Dont you think I was too young? You shoulda known &#39;, &#39;Mine (Live/)   You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables Left a small town and never looked back I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts  I say, Can you believe it? As were lying on the couch The moment, I could see it Yes, yes, I can see it now  Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine  Flash forward, and were taking on the world together And theres a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded You say well never make my parents mistakes  But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes This is what I thought about:  Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?

lookin over at me Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well  Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team You taught me bout your past, thinking your future was me  And I know its long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to  Cause there we are again in the middle of the night Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well, yeah  Well maybe we got lost in translation Maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece Til you tore it all up Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again Just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well  Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still trying to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah  Cause there we are

already flying through the freefall Like the colors in autumn So bright, just before they lose it all  Losing him was blue like Id never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met But loving him was red Loving him was red  Touching him was like Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you Memorizing him was as Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song Fighting with him was like Trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer Regretting him was like Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong  Losing him was blue like Id never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met But loving him was red Oh, red Burning red  Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes Tell myself its time now, gotta let go But moving on from him is impossible When I still see it all in my head In burning red Burning, it was red  Losing him was blue like Id never known Missing him was dark grey, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met Cause loving him was red Yeah, yeah, red Were burning red  And thats why hes spinning round in my head Burning red, burning red  His love was like Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street &#39;, &#39;I Almost Do   I bet this time of night,

Its so cool, I love these guitar sounds. And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called  I Wish You Would , because Jack wrote back and said I love that So this is another way of writing, its writing to track: Okay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would. Its kind of about this guy whos like, hes driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriends house and its like, he thinks she hate him, but shes still in love with him, very dramatic.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip . This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you . The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness.  Ive been in the public eye since I was  years old.  On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people.  On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing . When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test.  There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its  and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us . There will be no further explanation . There will be just reputation .  &#39;, &#39;If Youre Anything Like Me   If youre anything like me, You bite your nails, And laugh when youre nervous. You promise people the world, because thats what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If youre anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If youre anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If youre anything like me, Theres a justice system in your head For names youll never speak again, And you make your  ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If youre anything like me Youve grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at  Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If youre anything like me, You couldnt recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If youre anything like me, Im sorry. But Darling, its going to be okay.  &#39;, &#39;King Of My Heart   Im perfectly fine, I live on my own I made up my mind, Im better off bein alone We met a few weeks ago Now you try on callin me Baby like tryin on clothes  Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do  And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa  And all at once, Ive been waiting, waiting Ooh whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once  Late in the night, the citys asleep Your love is a secret Im hoping, dreaming, dying to keep Change my priorities The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury  Salute to me, Im your American queen And you move to me like Im a Motown beat And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh) Cause all the boys and their expensive cars With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)  And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa And all at once, youre all I want, Ill never let you go King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa  And all at once (Hey), Ive been waiting, waiting (Waiting) Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting) Body and soul, ooh whoa And all at once  Is this the end of all the endings?

Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right. Whatever you do, it is not enough. Your kindness is fake. Your pain is manipulative. When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here. And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive.  &#39;, &#39;Look What You Made Me Do   I dont like your little games Dont like your tilted stage The role you made me play Of the fool, no, I dont like you I dont like your perfect crime How you laugh when you lie You said the gun was mine Isnt cool, no, I dont like you (Oh)  But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!  Ooh, look what you made me do Look what you made me do Look what you just made me do Look what you just made me-- Ooh, look what you made me do Look what you made me do Look what you just made me do Look what you just made me do  I dont like your kingdom keys They once belonged to me You asked me for a place to sleep Locked me out and threw a feast (What?) The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma And then the world moves on, but one things for sure Maybe I got mine, but youll all get yours  But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time Ive got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

See you in the dark All eyes on you, my magician All eyes on us You make everyone disappear, and Cut me into pieces Gold cage, hostage to my feelings Back against the wall Trippin, trip-trippin when youre gone  Cause we break down a little But when you get me alone, its so simple Cause baby, I know what you know We can feel it  And all the pieces fall right into place Getting caught up in a moment Lipstick on your face So it goes...

## [14] &quot;Soon Youll Get Better   The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair In doctors office lighting, I didnt tell you I was scared That was the first time we were there Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too And I say to you...  Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Youll get better soon Cause you have to  I know delusion when I see it in the mirror You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal I just pretend it isnt real Ill paint the kitchen neon, Ill brighten up the sky I know Ill never get it, theres not a day that I wont try And I say to you...  Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Youll get better soon Cause you have to  And I hate to make this all about me But who am I supposed to talk to? What am I supposed to do If theres no you?  This wont go back to normal, if it ever was Its been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because Cause I have to  Ooh-ah Youll get better Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Youll get better soon Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Soon, youll get better Ooh-ah Youll get better soon Cause you have to  &#39;, &#39;I Forgot That You Existed (Piano/Vocal)   So the clip that youre about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadnt ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called I Forgot That You Existed, and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that youve been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize youre indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started  I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice (Humming) I forgot that you existed I forgot that you existed Thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice I forgot that you existed How Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice So peaceful and How many nights I, how you did me How many days did I wait thinking Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong? (Humming) I forgot that you existed I thought Id miss you but I didnt And it was so nice So peaceful and quiet I forgot that you existed  &#39;, &#39;Cornelia Street   We were in the backseat Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar I rent a place on Cornelia Street I say casually in the car We were a fresh page on the desk Filling in the blanks as we go As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head Leading us home  And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends Id never walk Cornelia Street again Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend Id never walk Cornelia Street again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again  Windows flung right open, autumn air Jacket round my shoulders is yours We bless the rains on Cornelia Street Memorize the creaks in the floor Back when we were card sharks, playing games I thought you were leading me on I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street Before you even knew I was gone  But then you called,  showed your hand I turned around before I hit the tunnel Sat on the roof, you and I  I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends Id never walk Cornelia Street again Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend Id never walk Cornelia Street again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again  You hold my hand on the street Walk me back to that apartment Years ago, we were just inside Barefoot in the kitchen Sacred new beginnings That became my religion, listen  I hope I never lose you Id never walk Cornelia Street again Oh, never again And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name And baby, Im so terrified of if you ever walk away Id never walk Cornelia Street again Id never walk Cornelia Street again  I dont wanna lose you (Hope it never ends) Id never walk Cornelia Street again I dont wanna lose you (Yeah)  I rent a place on Cornelia Street I say casually in the car  &#39;, &#39;Lover (Piano/Vocal)   Writing the song Lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano And this is what happened So it is, its basically, I dont see it as a piano. I think its that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so  We could leave the Christmas lights up til January This is our place, we make the rules And theres a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you  seconds or  years?  Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out, take me home Youre my, my, my, my lover  Yeah, I love the walk down I love the walk down I was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there So the, so  My, my, my, my lover  We could let our friends crash on the couches This is our place, we make the call And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you Ive loved you three summers now, honey, but I want em all  Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out, and take me home Youre my, my, my, my lover  Okay and then I have this bridge thing thats um, essentially Well, no I was I did, I did it in this key But it could be like a thing wheres like a key change So it plays off of the walk down-ish But its, this is the melody of it, it goes, its like  Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hands I take this magnetic force- Oh, fuck I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue Alls well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  Wait so goes like  And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, Ill save you a seat  So goes, and you, it goes  And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me My hearts been borrowed your hearts been blue Alls well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, Ill save you a seat  You like? Yeah! Ive never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday  &#39;, &#39;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince   You know I adore you, Im crazier for you Than I was at , lost in a film scene Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing Im lost in the lights American glory faded before me Now Im feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard And ran for my life (Ah)  No cameras catch my pageant smile I counted days, I counted miles To see you there, to see you there Its been a long time coming, but  Its you and me, thats my whole world They whisper in the hallway, Shes a bad, bad girl (Okay) The whole school is rolling fake dice You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes Its you and me, theres nothing like this Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay) Were so sad, we paint the town blue Voted most likely to run away with you  My team is losing, battered and bruising I see the high fives between the bad guys Leave with my head hung, you are the only one Who seems to care American stories burning before me Im feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?

## [15] &quot;august (the long pond studio sessions)   Salt air and the rust on your door I never needed anything more Whispers of Are you sure? Never have I ever before  But I can see us lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time Cause it was never mine And I can see us twisted in bedsheets August sipped away like a bottle of wine Cause you were never mine  Your back beneath the sun Wishin I could write my name on it Will you call when youre back at school? I remember thinkin I had you  But I can see us lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time Cause it was never mine And I can see us twisted in bedsheets August sipped away like a bottle of wine Cause you were never mine Ahh-ahh  Back when we were still changin for the better Wanting was enough For me, it was enough To live for the hope of it all Cancel plans just in case youd call And say, Meet me behind the mall So much for summer love and saying us Cause you werent mine to lose You werent mine to lose, no  Cause I can see us lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time Cause it was never mine And I can see us twisted in bedsheets August sipped away like a bottle of wine You were never mine  You were never mine Never mine Do you remember? Remember when I pulled up and said, Get in the car And then canceled my plans just in case youd call? Back when I was livin for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all Meet me behind the mall And then I canceled my plans just in case youd call Back when I was livin for the hope of it all, hope of it all Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car And then canceled my plans just in case youd call? Back when I was livin for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all Meet me behind the mall   Haha, I loved that  &#39;, &#39;gold rush   Gleaming, twinkling Eyes like sinking ships on waters So inviting, I almost jump in  But I dont like a gold rush, gold rush I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch Everybody wants you Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you Walk past, quick brush I dont like slow motion, double vision in rose blush I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush Everybody wants you But I dont like a gold rush  What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominoes I see me padding across your wooden floors With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door  At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit And the coastal town we wandered round had never seen a love as pure as it And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea Cause it could never be  Cause I dont like a gold rush, gold rush I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch Everybody wants you Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you Walk past, quick brush I dont like slow motion, double vision in rose blush I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush Everybody wants you But I dont like a gold rush  What must it be like to grow up that beautiful? With your hair falling into place like dominoes My mind turns your life into folklore I cant dare to dream about you anymore  At dinner parties I wont call you out on your contrarian shit And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea Cause it will never be  Gleaming, twinkling Eyes like sinking ships on waters So inviting, I almost jump in  &#39;, &#39;evermore   Gray November Ive been down since July Motion capture Put me in a bad light I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone Trying to find the one where I went wrong Writing letters Addressed to the fire  And I was catching my breath Staring out an open window Catching my death And I couldnt be sure I had a feeling so peculiar That this pain would be for Evermore  Hey December Guess Im feeling unmoored Cant remember What I used to fight for I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause On the very moment all was lost Sending signals To be double-crossed [Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp;  Justin Vernon ] And I was catching my breath Barefoot in the wildest winter Catching my death And I couldnt be sure I had a feeling so peculiar That this pain would be for Evermore ( Evermore )  Cant not think of all the cost And the things that will be lost Oh, can we just get a pause? To be certain, well be tall again Whether weather be the frost Or the violence of the dog days Im on waves, out being tossed Is there a line that I could just go cross? [Bridge : Taylor Swift &amp;  Justin Vernon ] And when I was shipwrecked ( Cant think of all the cost ) I thought of you ( All the things that will be lost now) In the cracks of light ( Can we just get a pause? ) I dreamed of you ( To be certain well be tall again, if you think of all the costs ) It was real enough ( Whether weather be the frost ) To get me through ( Or the violence of the dog days ) ( Or the violence of the dog days ) ( Out on waves, being tossed ) ( Im on waves, out being tossed ) I swear ( Is there a line that we can just go cross? ) You were there  And I was catching my breath Floors of a cabin creaking under my step And I couldnt be sure I had a feeling so peculiar This pain wouldnt be for Evermore Evermore Evermore This pain wouldnt be for evermore Evermore  &#39;, &#39;willow (moonlit witch version)   Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife And if it was an open-shut case I never wouldve known from that look on your face Lost in your current like a priceless wine  The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man  Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in As if you were a mythical thing Like you were a trophy or a champion ring And there was one prize Id cheat to win  The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man You know that my train could take you home Anywhere else is hollow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man  Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind They count me out time and time again Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind But I come back stronger than a s trend  Wait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark Show me the places where the others gave you scars Now this is an open-shut case I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face Every bait-and-switch was a work of art  The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man You know that my train could take you home Anywhere else is hollow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man The more that you say, the less I know Wherever you stray, I follow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man You know that my train could take you home Anywhere else is hollow Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man  Hey, thats my man Thats my man Yeah, thats my man Every bait-and-switch was a work of art Thats my man Hey, thats my man Im begging for you to take my hand Wreck my plans, thats my man  &#39;, &#39;Folklore   It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later.   Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down.   The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it.   The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.   A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor.   A whiskey bottle beckoning.   Hands held through plastic.   A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt.   An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong .  An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession .  A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize .  Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line .  My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in  .  A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around.  Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve Now its up to you to pass them down &#39;, &#39;dorothea   Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me? When we were younger down in the park Honey, making a lark of the misery You got shiny friends since you left town A tiny screens the only place I see you now And I got nothing but well wishes for ya  Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was Ooh, but you wont like it that way  Its never too late to come back to my side The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo And if youre ever tired of being known for who you know You know that youll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh) Dorothea (Ah-ah)  Ooh, youre a queen sellin dreams, sellin makeup and magazines Ooh, from you, Id buy anything  Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?

And I came up with this thing, and its probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing.   Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones When you are young, they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick Sensual politics When you are young, they assume you know nothing  But I knew you Dancin in your Levis Drunk under a streetlight, I I knew you Hand under my sweatshirt Baby, kiss it better, I  And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed You put me on and said I was your favorite  A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one When you are young, they assume you know nothing  But I knew you Living in a gold age Sneaking to my bird cage, I I knew you Laughing like a damn fool Breaking every damn rule, I  And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed You put me on and said I was your favorite  And then, I have like this-- theres like a break, because I dont really know whats gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think its here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing.   And to kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed You drew stars around my scars Now Im bleedin Im bleedin  Well work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, theres all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I dont think its right now, but... there it is. The ending.   Cause I knew you Steppin on the last train Marked me like a bloodstain, I I knew you Tried to change the ending Peter leaving Wendy, I I knew you Dancing in your Levis Drunk under a streetlight, I I knew you That when you are young, they assume you know nothing  But I knew youd linger like a stolen kiss I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young I knew Id curse you for the longest time I knew Id wish you wouldve changed your mind I knew youd miss me once the moment died I knew to love would be to lose my mind And then, I dont know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, thats just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it.   &#39;, &#39;mirrorball   I want you to know Im a mirrorball Ill show you every version of yourself tonight Ill get you out on the floor Shimmering beautiful And when I break, its in a million pieces  Hush, when no one is around, my dear Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes Spinning in my highest heels, love Shining just for you Hush, I know they said the end is near But Im still on my tallest tiptoes Spinning in my highest heels, love Shining just for you  I want you to know Im a mirrorball I can change everything about me to fit in You are not like the regulars The masquerade revelers Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten  Hush, when no one is around, my dear Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes Spinning in my highest heels, love Shining just for you Hush, I know they said the end is near But Im still on my tallest tiptoes Spinning in my highest heels, love Shining just for you  And they called off the circus , burned the disco down When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns Im still on that tightrope Im still trying everything to get you laughing at me And Im still a believer, but I dont know why Ive never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try Im still on that trapeze Im still trying everything to keep you looking at me  Because Im a mirrorball Im a mirrorball And Ill show you every version of yourself tonight  &#39;, &#39;betty (the long pond studio sessions)   Betty, I wont make assumptions About why you switched your homeroom, but I think its cause of me Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard When I passed your house Its like I couldnt breathe  You heard the rumors from Inez You cant believe a word she says Most times, but this time it was true The worst thing that I ever did Was what I did to you  But if I just showed up at your party Would you have me?

unforgiven Ill tell you the truth, but never goodbye  I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night But now I see daylight I only see daylight  Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky So I became the butt of the joke I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now Its brighter now, now  I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you ( I can never look away ) I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you ( Things Im never gonna say ) Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night ( Now Im wide awake ) But now I see daylight I only see daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight  And I can still see it all in my mind All of you, all of me intertwined I once believed love would be black and white But its golden golden And I can still see it all in my head Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed I once believed love would be burning red But its golden Like daylight, like daylight Like daylight, like daylight  I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you ( I can never look away ) I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you ( Things Im never gonna say ) Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night ( Now Im wide awake ) But now I see daylight I only see daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight  You gotta step into the daylight and let it go Just let it go, let it go &#39;, &#39;marjorie   Never be so kind You forget to be clever

didnt stay dead Youre alive, youre alive in my head What died didnt stay dead What died didnt stay dead Youre alive, so alive  Never be so polite You forget your power Never wield such power You forget to be polite  And if I didnt know better Id think you were listening to me now If I didnt know better Id think you were still around  What died didnt stay dead What died didnt stay dead Youre alive, youre alive in my head What died didnt stay dead What died didnt stay dead Youre alive, so alive  The autumn chill that wakes me up You loved the amber skies so much Long limbs and frozen swims Youd always go past where our feet could touch And I complained the whole way there The car ride back and up the stairs I shouldve asked you questions I shouldve asked you how to be Asked you to write it down for me Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me Watched as you signed your name Marjorie All your closets of backlogged dreams And how you left them all to me  What died didnt stay dead What died didnt stay dead Youre alive, youre alive in my head What died didnt stay dead What died didnt stay dead Youre alive, so alive  And if I didnt know better Id think you were singing to me now If I didnt know better Id think you were still around I know better But I still feel you all around I know better But youre still around  &#39;, &#39;this is me trying   Ive been having a hard time adjusting I had the shiniest wheels, now theyre rusting I didnt know if youd care if I came back I have a lot of regrets about that Pulled the car off the road to the lookout Couldve followed my fears all the way down And maybe I dont quite know what to say But Im here in your doorway  I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying  They told me all of my cages were mental So I got wasted like all my potential And my words shoot to kill when Im mad I have a lot of regrets about that I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here Pouring out my heart to a stranger But I didnt pour the whiskey  I just wanted you to know that this is me trying I just wanted you to know that this is me trying  At least Im trying  And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you Youre a flashback in a film reel   on the one screen in my town  And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying (And maybe I dont quite know what to say) I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

Because I dropped your hand while dancing Left you out there standing Crestfallen on the landing Champagne problems Your moms ring in your pocket My picture in your wallet Your heart was glass, I dropped it Champagne problems  You told your family for a reason You couldnt keep it in Your sister splashed out on the bottle Now no ones celebrating  Dom Perignon, you brought it No crowd of friends applauded Your hometown skeptics called it Champagne problems You had a speech, youre speechless Love slipped beyond your reaches And I couldnt give a reason Champagne problems  Your Midas touch on the Chevy door November flush and your flannel cure This dorm was once a madhouse I made a joke, Well, its made for me How evergreen, our group of friends Dont think well say that word again And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls That we once walked through One for the money, two for the show I never was ready so I watch you go Sometimes you just dont know the answer Til someones on their knees and asks you She wouldve made such a lovely bride What a shame shes fucked in the head, they said But youll find the real thing instead Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred Related Songs  And hold your hand while dancing Never leave you standing Crestfallen on the landing With champagne problems Your moms ring in your pocket Her picture in your wallet You wont remember all my

## [16] &quot;State Of Grace (Acoustic Version)    Im walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know is touch and go We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds Or fades in time  And I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same  You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannonball Now all we know is dont let go We are alone, just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes  So you were never a saint And Ive loved in shades of wrong We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild  I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate Youre my Achilles heel This is the golden age of something good and right and real  And I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same, oh Oh, I never saw you comin And Ill never be the same  This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right  &#39;, &#39;I Knew You Were Trouble

Please, tell me Cause one second it was perfect Now youre halfway out the door  And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all And you flashback to when he said, Forever and always And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone I was there when you said, Forever and always  Was I out of line? Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide Like a scared little boy? I looked into your eyes Thought I knew you for a minute, now Im not so sure So heres to everything coming down to nothing Heres to silence that cuts me to the core Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I dont anymore  And I stare at the phone, he still hasnt called And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all You flashback to when he said, Forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone I was there when you said, Forever and always You didnt mean it baby, I dont think so  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh Back up, baby, back up Did you forget everything?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin in a party bathroom Some actress askin me what happened, you Thats what happened, you You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes Sippin coffee like youre on a late-night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin you to come And he said, Its supposed to be fun turning twenty-one  Time wont fly, its like Im paralyzed by it Id like to be my old self again, but Im still tryin to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You cant get rid of it Cause you remember it all too well, yeah  Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair, you were there You remember it all Down the stairs, you were there You remember it all It was rare, I was there I remember it all too well  And I was never good at tellin jokes, but the punch line goes Ill get older, but your lovers stay my age From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones Im a soldier whos returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

strange that you think Im funny cause he never did Ive been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again  You said you never met one girl who Had as many James Taylor records as you But I do We tell stories and you dont know why Im coming off a little shy But I do  But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did Ive been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again   And we walked down the block to my car And I almost brought him up But you start to talk about the movies That your family watches every single Christmas And I want to talk about that And for the first time, whats past is past  Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did Ive been spending the last eight months Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again  On a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again  &#39;, &#39;I Bet You Think About Me (Taylors Version)     AM and Im still awake, Ill bet youre just fine Fast asleep in your city thats better than mine And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree And Ill bet your friends tell you shes better than me, huh  Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love Oh, they sit around talkin about the meaning of life And the book that just saved em that I hadnt heard of [Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton,  Taylor Swift ] But now that were done and its over I bet you couldnt believe When you realized Im harder to forget than I was to leave And I bet you think about me  You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills I was raised on a farm, no, it wasnt a mansion Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills  But you know what they say, you cant help who you fall for And you and I fell like an early spring snow But reality crept in, you said were too different You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes [Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton,  Taylor Swift ] Mr. Superior Thinkin Do you have all the space that you need? I dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy And I bet you think about me [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift,  Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton ] I bet you think about  me, yes I bet you think about me [Bridge: Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton,  Taylor Swift ] Oh, block it all out The voices so loud, sayin Why did you let her go? Does it make you feel sad That the love that youre lookin for Is the love that you had?  Now youre out in the world, searchin for your soul Scared not to be hip, scared to get old Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me [Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton,  Taylor Swift ] But now that were done and its over I bet its hard to believe But it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave And, yeah , I bet you think about me [Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift,  Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton ] I bet you think about  me, yes I bet you think about me [Outro: Taylor Swift,  Taylor Swift &amp; Chris Stapleton ] I bet you think about me when youre out At your  cool indie music concerts every week I bet you think about me in your house With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch I bet you think about me when you say Oh my god, shes insane, she wrote a song about me I bet you think about me  &#39;, &#39;Better Man (Taylors Version)    I know Im probably better off on my own Than lovin a man who didnt know what he had when he had it And I see the permanent damage you did to me Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic  I wish it wasnt  AM, standing in the mirror Saying to myself, You know you had to do it I know the bravest thing I ever did was run  Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man  I know Im probably better off all alone Than needing a man who could change his mind At any given minute And it was always on your terms I waited on every careless word Hoping they might turn sweet again Like it was in the beginning  But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now Talking down to me like Id always be around Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun Oh, you never thought Id run  Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man Related Songs  I hold onto this pride because these days its all I have And I gave to you my best And we both know you cant say that I wish you were a better man I wonder what we wouldve become If you were a better man We might still be in love If you were a better man You wouldve been the one If you were a better man Yeah, yeah  Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man A better man (Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again) We might still be in love, if you were a better man (But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man) Yeah, yeah I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man A better man  We might still be in love If you were a better man You wouldve been the one If you were a better man  &#39;, &#39;Babe (Taylors Version)    What about your promises, promises?

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>We began by extracting [song lyrics] labeled according to the year they were recorded by TSwift using <a href="https://github.com/redapemusic35/CorpusGenius">JatanJay’s CorpusGenius</a>. This resulted in 17 years worth of song lyrics recorded by TSwift from 2002 to 2022. There were some questionable lyrics object, notably the first songs in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, rows are the same. It is not likely that Swift recorded separate versions for the same song four years in a row.</p>
<p>We then used <span class="citation">@alfa18</span>‘s MAC-D to calculate the percentage of words in each paragraph that was present in each of the seven moral foundations. (A score of ‘10%’ for ‘heroism’, for example, means that 10% of the words in a given paragraph are in the heroism dictionary.).</p>
<p>Looking at the family moral foundations, at 14%, 2010 contains the highest consentration of words from that foundation.</p>

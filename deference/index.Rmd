title: "Deference and the Moral Properties of Imaginative Experience"
author: "Montaque Reynolds"
abstract: "When our moral views are based on the moral views of another, we are in a state of deference to that person. There are philosophers who think that such a state is not ideal. Sarah @mcgr19 defends moral deference arguing that it is no different than non-moral deference. It is natural for us to accept the moral views of others even if we have not critically examined the views for ourselves. Our actions are often justified by the views of expert testimony, say when a Supreme Court justice rules on a case based on the testimony of a scientific expert.^[E.g., see @daub93] However, this assumes one direction of fit between emotion and moral judgment, which is a narrow understanding of how we can know moral facts. While such an understanding may or may not be true in the non-moral realm, there are important differences between the moral and non-moral claims. Most important among these differences is how we feel about them. This means that our understanding of how we come to know moral facts may be too narrow."
